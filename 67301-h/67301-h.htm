<h2 class="nobreak">HOW BATTLES ARE FOUGHT<br />
<br />

<small><i>A PREFATORY EXPLANATION FOR THE BENEFIT<br />
OF THOSE WHO KNOW NOTHING<br />
ABOUT THE MATTER</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> squads or scouting parties meet each
other, they either fight in an irregular fashion
or they run away.</p>

<p>With a systematic battle it is different.</p>

<p>Before a systematic battle, one army selects
some place at which to resist the advance of
the other.</p>

<p>The advancing army usually cannot leave the
other aside and go on by another route to the
capital city which it wants to reach, because, if
it did, the army left aside would quickly destroy
what is called the advancing army&#8217;s &#8220;communications.&#8221;</p>

<p>To destroy these communications would be to
cut off supplies of food, ammunition, and everything
else necessary to an army.</p>

<p>The army which takes the defensive selects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
some point that can be most easily defended,&mdash;some
point where a river or a creek, or a line
of hills, or something else, serves to give it the
advantage in a fight.</p>

<p>The enemy must either attack that army
there, and drive it out of its position, or it must
&#8220;flank&#8221; it out, if it is itself to go forward.</p>

<p>To &#8220;flank&#8221; an army out of position is not
merely to pass it by, which, as explained above,
might be dangerous, but to seize upon some
point or some road, the possession of which will
compel that army to retire.</p>

<p>Thus, when General Lee could not be driven
out of his works at Fredericksburg by direct
attack, General Hooker marched his army up
the river, and by crossing there placed himself
nearer Richmond than General Lee was. This
compelled General Lee to abandon his position
at Fredericksburg, and to meet General Hooker
in the open field; otherwise there would have
been nothing to prevent General Hooker from
going to Richmond, with a part of his greatly
superior force, leaving the rest of it to check
any operations Lee might have undertaken
against his communications.</p>

<p>It is in some such fashion as this that every
battle is brought about. One side is ever trying
to get somewhere, and the other side is ever
trying to prevent it from doing so. Incidentally,
each army is trying to destroy the other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>When one army has planted itself in a position
of its choice, and the other advances to
attack it, this is what happens:&mdash;</p>

<p>The army that is standing still throws out
lines of pickets in front to watch for the enemy&#8217;s
advance and report it.</p>

<p>The enemy, as he advances, also throws out a
cloud of skirmishers to &#8220;feel&#8221; of the position
and avoid traps and ambushes.</p>

<p>A line of battle often extends over several
miles in length, covering all available ground
for attack or defence.</p>

<p>Before the advancing general can determine
against what part of his adversary&#8217;s line to hurl
his heaviest battalions, he must study the conditions
along that line; namely, by means of his
skirmishers.</p>

<p>In the same way the general who is awaiting
attack tries to discover through his skirmishers
what his enemy&#8217;s plan of battle is, and at what
points he most needs to concentrate his own
men.</p>

<p>While awaiting this information he posts his
men&mdash;cavalry, artillery, and infantry&mdash;wherever
he thinks they will be most useful, having
reference all the time to their rapid movement
during the battle from one part of the line to
another, as occasion may demand.</p>

<p>He also holds a considerable part of his army
&#8220;in reserve.&#8221; That is to say, he stations it at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
points a little in rear of the line of battle, from
which he can order all or any part of it to any
point where strength may be needed.</p>

<p>In a great battle, involving large bodies of
troops, each corps or division commander must
do in a smaller way what the general-in-chief
does on a larger scale. Each has charge of the
battle on a certain part of the line. Each
must take care of things within his own jurisdiction,
and be ready at a moment&#8217;s notice to
respond to the demand of the commanding general
for troops with which to help out elsewhere.</p>

<p>These are the generalities. Let us now come
to the battle itself.</p>

<p>When the skirmishers of the advancing army
meet the skirmishers of the resisting army, there
is apt to be some pretty hot fighting for a time,
and sometimes the artillery is considerably involved
in it. But this is not the real thing;
it is a mere preliminary to the actual battle.</p>

<p>The army that is standing on the defensive
holds its lines in position&mdash;every battery placed
where it will do the most good, and every infantryman
lying down and taking the utmost
advantage of every tree stump, log, or inequality
of the ground, to protect himself as much as
possible.</p>

<p>The men on horseback are either in front with
the skirmishers, minutely observing the strength
and movements of the enemy, or, having finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
that work, are thrown out at the two ends
of the lines, called &#8220;flanks,&#8221; to watch there for
possible movements of the enemy that might
be otherwise unobserved. They are within call
of any part of the line where need of them
may arise.</p>

<p>While the skirmishers are doing their work,
the heaviest strain of war falls on the nerves of
the men in line of battle.</p>

<p>They have nothing to do but wait.</p>

<p>They wait with the certain knowledge that in
a few minutes the advancing army will throw
men forward, and thus convert its skirmish line
into a line of attack; while on their own side
they know that their skirmish line, after making
all of discovery that temporary resistance can
accomplish, will fall back, and that then the
crucial conflict will begin.</p>

<p>Then comes the uproar of battle,&mdash;the dust,
the blood, the advance, the retreat, the shock of
arms, the murderous volleys of the infantry,
the thunder storm of artillery; in short, the
final desperate conflict of determined men for
the mastery, all of them directed by cool-headed
commanders, sitting on their horses at points of
vantage for observation, and directing a reinforcement
here, a withdrawal of men there, the
hurrying of artillery to one point, an onset of
cavalry at another, and at a critical moment an
up-and-at-them charge with the bayonets. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
usually ends matters one way or the other at
the point involved. For only two or three times
in any war do men with fixed bayonets on one
side actually meet in physical shock men armed
with fixed bayonets on the other.</p>

<p>Wherever there is advantage on either side,
the general commanding that side throws troops
forward in as heavy masses as possible to make
the most of it. If one line or the other be
broken, every conceivable effort is made to convert
the breach into victory. And if victory
comes, the cavalry thunder forward in pursuit
and in an endeavor to convert the enemy&#8217;s
defeat into rout.</p>

<p>This is only a general description. I hope
that no old soldier on either side will read it. It
is not intended for such as they. It is written
<i>virginibus puerisque</i>, and for other people who
don&#8217;t know anything about the subject. It is
printed here in the hope that it may enable

<h2 class="nobreak">JOE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">JOE was very much in earnest at Pocotaligo,
South Carolina, where a great little battle
was fought on the 22d of October, 1862.</p>

<p>That is to say, Joe was not quite seventeen
years old, was an enthusiastic soldier, and was
as hot headed as a boy well can be.</p>

<p>We had two batteries and a few companies
of mounted riflemen&mdash;three hundred and fifty-one
men all told&mdash;to oppose the advance of
five thousand. We had only the nature of the
country, the impassability of the marshes, and
the long high causeways to enable us to make
any resistance at all.</p>

<p>Before the battle of Pocotaligo proper began,
we went two miles below to Yemassee and there
made a stand of half an hour.</p>

<p>Our battery, numbering fifty-four men, received
the brunt of the attack.</p>

<p>Joe had command of a gun.</p>

<p>His men fell like weeds before a scythe. Presently
he found himself with only three men left
with whom to work a gun.</p>

<p>The other battery was that of Captain Elliot
of South Carolina; and Captain Elliot had just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
been designated Chief of Artillery. Elliot&#8217;s
battery was really not in action at all. Joe seeing
Captain Elliot, and being himself full of the
enthusiasm which insists upon getting things
done, appealed to the Chief of Artillery for the
loan of some cannoneers with whom to work
his gun more effectively. Captain Elliot declined.
Thereupon Joe broke into a volley of
vituperation, calling the captain and his battery
cowards, and by other pet names not here to
be reported.</p>

<p>I, being Joe&#8217;s immediate chief, as well as his
elder brother, commanded him to silence and
ordered him back to his gun. There he stood
for fifteen minutes astride a dead man and pulling
the lanyard himself. At the end of that
time we were ordered to retire to Pocotaligo.</p>

<p>Joe was flushed, powder grimed, and very
angry; so angry that even I came in for a
part of his displeasure. When I asked him, in
order that I might make report for the section,
how many shots he had fired, he blazed out at
me: &#8220;How do I know? I&#8217;ve been killing
Yankees, not counting shots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many rounds have you left in your
limber-chest, Joe?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>He turned up the lid of the chest, and replied:
&#8220;Five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the chest had fifty, hadn&#8217;t it, when
you went into action?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you fired forty-five, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose so, I don&#8217;t know! Confound
these technicalities, anyhow! I&#8217;m <i>fighting</i>, not
counting! Do your own arithmetic!&#8221;</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t a very subordinate speech for a
sergeant to make to the commander of his section,
but Joe was my brother, and I loved him.</p>

<p>At Pocotaligo he fought his gun with superb
devotion and effect. But he remained mad all
over and clear through till two o&#8217;clock that
night. At that hour I was able to persuade
him that he had been indiscreet in his remarks
to the Chief of Artillery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I was,&#8221; he said, grasping my hand;
&#8220;but you&#8217;re not to worry, old fellow; I&#8217;ll stand
the consequences, and you&#8217;re the best that ever
was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless I did worry, knowing that such
an offence was punishable without limit in the
discretion of a court-martial. It was scarcely
sunrise the next morning when I appeared at
Captain Elliot&#8217;s headquarters. I had ridden
for half an hour, I suppose, my mind all the
time recalling a certain military execution I had
seen; but this morning I imagined Joe in the
r&ocirc;le of victim. I had not slept, of course, and
my nerves were all on edge.</p>

<p>I entered headquarters with a degree of trepidation
which I had never felt before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Captain Elliot was performing his ablutions
as well as he could, with a big gourd for basin.
He nodded and spoke with his head in the
towel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good fight, wasn&#8217;t it? We have a lot of
those fellows to bury this morning. Pretty
good bag for three hundred and fifty-one of us,
and it was mainly your battery&#8217;s cannister that
did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I changed feet and said, &#8220;Y&mdash;e&mdash;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought to myself that that was about the
way <i>I</i> should take to &#8220;let a man down easy&#8221; in
a hard case.</p>

<p>The captain carefully removed the soap from
his ears, then turning to me said: &#8220;That&#8217;s a
<i>fighter</i>, that brother of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I replied; &#8220;but, captain, he is very
young, very enthusiastic, and very hot-tempered;
I hope&mdash;I hope you&#8217;ll overlook&mdash;his&mdash;er&mdash;intemperateness
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Thunder, man, do you suppose I&#8217;ve got
any grudge against a fellow that fights
like that?</span>&#8221; roared the gallant captain.</p>

<p>As I rode back through the woods, it seemed
to me about the brightest October morning that
I had ever seen, even in that superb Carolina
climate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AROUND THE CAMP-FIRE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was a kind of off-night, the 23d of October,
1862, twenty-four hours after the battle of
Pocotaligo, on the South Carolina coast.</p>

<p>We had to stop over there until morning,
because the creek was out of its banks, and we
couldn&#8217;t get across without daylight. There
were only about a dozen of us, and we had to
build a camp-fire under the trees.</p>

<p>After supper we fell to talking, and naturally
we talked of war things. There wasn&#8217;t anything
else to talk about then.</p>

<p>There was the long-legged mountaineer, with
the deep voice, and the drawl in his speech which
aided the suggestion that he kept his voice in
his boots and had to pump it up when anything
was to be said. Opposite him was the alert,
rapid-speaking fellow, who had come in as a
conscript and had made a superb volunteer,&mdash;a
fellow who had an opinion ready made on every
subject that could be mentioned, and who was
accustomed to wind up most conversations with
a remark so philosophical as to seem strangely
out of keeping with the rest of the inconsequent
things that he had said. Then there were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
two mountaineers who never said anything because
they never had anything to say. They
had reached that point of intellectual development
where the theory is accepted that there
ought to be thought behind every utterance;
and under this misapprehension they abstained
from utterance.</p>

<p>Joe was there, but Joe wasn&#8217;t talking that
night. Joe was surly and sullen. He had had
to kill his horse at Pocotaligo the day before,
and all the honors he had harvested from that
action had not reconciled him to the loss. The
new horse he had drawn was, in his opinion,
&#8220;a beast.&#8221; Of course all horses are beasts, but
that isn&#8217;t precisely what Joe meant. Besides,
he had received a letter from his sweetheart just
before we left camp,&mdash;she&#8217;s his wife now, and
the mother of his dozen or more children,&mdash;in
which that young woman had expressed doubts
as to whether, after all, he was precisely the
kind of man to whom she ought to &#8220;give her
life.&#8221; Joe was only seventeen years of age at
that time, and he minded little things like that.
Still again, Joe had the toothache. Besides that,
we were hungry after our exceedingly scant
meal of roasted sweet potatoes. Besides that,
it was raining.</p>

<p>All the circumstances contributed to make us
introspective and psychological in our conversation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>The long-legged mountaineer with the deep
voice was telling some entirely inconsequent
story about somebody who wasn&#8217;t known to any
of us, and none of us was listening. After a
while he said: &#8220;He was that sort of a feller
that never felt fear in his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>From Joe: &#8220;There never was any such
fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The long mountaineer: &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what he
<i>said</i>, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>From Joe: &#8220;He lied, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued the long-legged mountaineer,
&#8220;that&#8217;s what he said, and he sort o&#8217; lived up
to it. If he had any fear, he didn&#8217;t show it till
that time I was tellin&#8217; you about, when he went
all to pieces and showed the white feather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; growled Joe, &#8220;what did I tell you?
He was lying all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The postscript philosopher on the other side
of the fire broke in, saying: &#8220;Well, maybe his
breakfast went bad on him that morning. An
overdone egg would make a coward out of the
Duke of Wellington.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe made the general reflection that &#8220;some
people locate their courage in their transverse
colons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a transverse colon?&#8221; asked one of
the mountaineers. Joe got up, stretched himself,
and made no answer. Perhaps none was
expected.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; asked the long-legged mountaineer,
&#8220;ain&#8217;t they people that don&#8217;t feel no fear?&#8221;</p>

<p>The glib little fellow quickly responded:
&#8220;Let&#8217;s find out. Let&#8217;s hold an experience
meeting. I suppose we&#8217;re a pretty fairly representative
body, and I move that each fellow tells
honestly how he feels when he is going into
battle; for instance, when the skirmishers are
at work in front, and we know that the next two
minutes will bring on the business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Infernally bad,&#8221; growled Joe; &#8220;and anybody
that pretends to feel otherwise lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>The postscript philosopher replied: &#8220;I never
saw <i>you</i> show any fear, Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m too big a coward to show
it,&#8221; said Joe.</p>

<p>Even the two reticent mountaineers understood
that.</p>

<p>One of them was moved to break the silence.
At last he had, if not a thought, yet an emotion
to stand sponsor for utterance.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> always feel,&#8221; said he, &#8220;as though the
squegees had took hold of my knees. There
ain&#8217;t anything of me for about a minute&mdash;exceptin&#8217;
a spot in the small of my back. I always
wish I was a woman or a baby, or dead or
something like that. After a while I git holt of
myself and I says to myself, &#8216;Bill, you&#8217;ve got
to stand up to the rack, fodder or no fodder.&#8217;
After that it all comes sort of easy like, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
know, because the firin&#8217; begins, and after the
firin&#8217; begins you&#8217;re doin&#8217; somethin&#8217;, you see, and
when you&#8217;re fightin&#8217; like, things don&#8217;t seem so
bad. I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ve all <i>noticed</i> that.&#8221;</p>

<p>From Joe: &#8220;In all the works on psychology
it has been recognized as a universal principle,
that the mind when occupied with a superior
consideration is able to free itself from considerations
of a lesser sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mountaineer looked at him helplessly and
said nothing.</p>

<p>The postscript philosopher began: &#8220;I shall
never forget my first battle. It wasn&#8217;t much of
a battle either, but it was lively while it lasted.
Unfortunately for me it was one of those fights
where you have to wait for the enemy to begin.
I was tender then. I had just left home, and
every time I looked at the little knickknacks
mother and the girls had given me to make
camp life comfortable,&mdash;for bless my soul they
thought we <i>lived</i> in camp,&mdash;every time I
looked at these things I grew teary. There
oughtn&#8217;t to be any bric-&agrave;-brac of that kind given
to a fellow when he goes into the army. It
isn&#8217;t fit. It worries him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent for a minute. So were the rest
of us. We all had bric-&agrave;-brac to remember. He
resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;We were lying there in the edge of a piece
of woods with a sloping meadow in front, crossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
by a stone wall heavily overgrown with vines.
At the other edge of the meadow was another
strip of woods. The enemy were somewhere
in there. We knew they were coming, because
the pickets had been driven in, and we stood
there waiting for them. The waiting was the
worst of it, and as we waited I got to feeling
in my pockets and&mdash;pulled out a little, old
three-cornered pincushion. Conscience knows I
wouldn&#8217;t have pulled out that pincushion at that
particular minute to have won a battle. I&#8217;ve got
it now. I never had any use for a pincushion
because I never could pin any two things together
the way a woman can, but a man can&#8217;t
make his womenkind believe that: I&#8217;ve kept it
all through the war, and when I go back home&mdash;if
it suits the Yankees that I ever go back at
all&mdash;I&#8217;m going to give it as a souvenir to the
little sister that made it for me. And I&#8217;m going
to tell her that it was that pincushion, little three-cornered
thing that it is, that made a man out of
me that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;My first thought as I pulled it out was that
I wanted to go home and give the war up; but
then came another kind of a thought. I said,
&#8216;The little girl wouldn&#8217;t have given that pincushion
to me if she hadn&#8217;t understood that I was
going off to fight for the country.&#8217; So I said to
myself, &#8216;Old boy, you&#8217;ve got to stand your hand
pat.&#8217; And now whenever we go into battle I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
always brace myself up a little by feeling in my
breeches pocket and sort of shaping out that
pincushion.&#8221;</p>

<p>From Joe: &#8220;It&#8217;s a good story, but the rest of
us haven&#8217;t any pincushions. Besides that, it&#8217;s
raining.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t help observing that Joe
drew that afternoon&#8217;s letter out of his pocket
and fumbled it a little, while the long-legged
mountaineer was straightening out his limbs and
his thoughts for his share in the conversation.
He said in basso profundo: &#8220;The fact is I&#8217;m
always so skeered just before a fight that I
can&#8217;t remember afterwards how I did feel. I
know only this much, that that last three minutes
before the bullets begin to whistle and the shells
to howl, takes more out of me than six hours
straightaway fightin&#8217; afterwards does.&#8221;</p>

<p>From Joe: &#8220;There must be a lot in you at
the start, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were still two men unheard from in the
experience meeting. Some one of us called
upon them for an expression of opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I donno. I never thought,&#8221; said one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nuther did I,&#8221; said the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Joe.</p>

<p>Then the postscript philosopher, rising and
stretching himself, remarked: &#8220;I reckon that
if any man goes into a fight without being
scared, that man is drunk or crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then we all lay down and went to sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AN UNFINISHED FIGHT</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">JACK SWAN was the best swordsman in
the regiment&mdash;probably the best in the
army. Jack was a Marylander, who came south
singing &#8220;My Maryland,&#8221; and heartily believing
in the assertion of that song that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;She breathes, she burns, she&#8217;ll come, she&#8217;ll come,</div>
<div class="verse">Maryland, my Maryland!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Like most men from border states he represented
a house divided against itself. In his
case the division was peculiarly distressing.</p>

<p>He was an enthusiastic Southerner. His twin
brother was an equally enthusiastic Union man.
The one was in the one army as a matter of
conscience, and the other in the other for precisely
the same reason. It was always a grief
to Jack that this separation had come between
him and the curly-headed twin brother, with
whom he had slept in infancy, and who had
been his comrade until that terrible fratricidal
war had parted them.</p>

<p>He used to talk with us about it around the
camp-fire, and was especially sad over it when
any of us managed to get off for a day or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
week to visit our homes. His home was beyond
the lines; and in all that country for which he
was fighting there was no human being whom
he could call kin.</p>

<p>He had this comfort, however, that his brother
and he were never likely to meet in the conflict
of arms. For to avoid that the brother had
betaken himself to the West and was serving in
Mississippi. But there was always the terrible
chance that in the shifting of troops they two
might some day, unknown to each other, be fighting
on opposite sides of the same field. That,
in fact, is what happened at Brandy Station,
and it happened more dramatically than either
of the brothers had anticipated.</p>

<p>The conflict at Brandy Station was perhaps
the greatest cavalry fight of the war. It was
the one contest in which large bodies of armed
and trained horsemen, under the greatest cavalry
leaders on either side, met fairly in conflict with
little or no interference from troops of other
arms.</p>

<p>It was the only contest of the kind, so far as
I know, in which highly expert swordsmen met
each other fairly in single combat. There was
on both sides a chivalric feeling akin to that of
the &#8220;knights of old,&#8221; which prompted men not
to interfere when two well-matched cavaliers
met each other with naked blades.</p>

<p>Jack Swan was naturally eager for a fray of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
this sort. He knew and mightily rejoiced in his
superb skill with the sabre.</p>

<p>He watched anxiously for his opportunity.
Presently it came.</p>

<p>A singularly lithe young fellow from one of
the Northern regiments met and slew, in the
open field, one of our officers. Thereupon Jack
turned to his captain and said: &#8220;If I have your
leave, captain, I&#8217;d like to try conclusions with
that young fellow myself. He seems to know
how to handle sharp steel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain nodded assent, and Jack put
spurs to his horse. The two men met in midfield.
They crossed swords as a couple of gladiators
might, while a thousand eyes watched
anxiously for the result.</p>

<p>It was manifestly to be a contest of experts,
a battle of the giants, for both men were above
the average in height and weight, and both
knew every trick of the sabre.</p>

<p>Their swords drew fire from each other&#8217;s
edge at the first onset.</p>

<p>Then they paused strangely and looked at
each other. Then Jack deliberately threw his
sabre upon the ground and uncovered his head.</p>

<p>His adversary could have run him through
on the instant, but the action of Jack seemed to
give him pause. He stopped with his sword
poised at the tierce thrust. He leant forward
eagerly and gazed into the calm eyes of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
Confederate. Then he, too, abandoning his
purpose, threw his weapon to the ground.</p>

<p>We were all eagerness and curiosity; and
neither our eagerness nor our curiosity was relieved
when the two men grasped each other&#8217;s
hand, swung their horses around, and each
returned unarmed to his own line.</p>

<p>When Jack rode up he had just six words of
explanation to make.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is my twin brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>That seemed to be all there was to say.
&#8220;Blood is thicker than water.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A FAMILY THAT HAD NO LUCK</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE were two instances of supreme
heroism in the Civil War. One was upon
the one side, the other upon the other.</p>

<p>One was the charge of Pickett&#8217;s Southerners
at Gettysburg. The other was the heroic series
of assaults, made by the Northern troops on
Marye&#8217;s Heights, at Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>General Lee&#8217;s works in the last-named battle
were high up on the hill. Crossing the field in
front of them was a sunken road&mdash;a perfect
breastwork already formed. The main body of
the army was in the works above; but a multitude
of us were thrown forward into the sunken
road.</p>

<p>The enemy knew nothing of this geographical
peculiarity. But their first advance revealed
the impossibility of breaking Lee&#8217;s lines at that
point. The column that advanced was swept
away as with a broom before it got within firing
distance of the works it supposed itself to be
attacking. The men knew what that meant.
Wiser than their general, they saw the necessity
of selecting some other point of attack. Nevertheless
when their commander persisted, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
six times came unflinchingly to an assault which
every man of them knew to be hopeless. This
may not have been war, but it was heroism.</p>

<p>We who faced them there honored it as such.</p>

<p>Just as we tumbled into the sunken road, an
old man came in bearing an Enfield rifle and
wearing an old pot hat of the date of 1857 or
thereabouts. With a gentle courtesy that was
unusual in war, he apologized to the two men
between whom he placed himself, saying: &#8220;I
hope I don&#8217;t crowd you, but I must find a place
somewhere from which I can shoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment one of the great assaults
occurred. The old man used his gun like an
expert. He wasted no bullet. He took aim
every time and fired only when he knew his
aim to be effective. Yet he fired rapidly. Tom
Booker, who stood next to him, said as the advancing
column was swept away: &#8220;You must
have shot birds on the wing in your time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man answered: &#8220;I did up to twenty
year ago; but then I sort o&#8217; lost my sight, you
know, and my interest in shootin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got &#8217;em both back again,&#8221;
called out Billy Goodwin from down the line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;You see I had
to. It&#8217;s this way: I had six boys and six gells.
When the war broke out I thought the six boys
could do my family&#8217;s share o&#8217; the fightin&#8217;. Well,
they did their best, but they didn&#8217;t have no luck.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
One of &#8217;em was killed at Manassas, two others
in a cavalry raid, and the other three fell in different
actions&mdash;&#8217;long the road as you might say.
We ain&#8217;t seemed to a had no luck. But it&#8217;s just
come to this, that if the family is to be represented,
the old man must git up his shootin&#8217;
agin, or else one o&#8217; the gells would have to take
a hand. So here I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the third advance was made. A
tremendous column of heroic fellows was hurled
upon us, only to be swept away as its predecessors
had been. Two or three minutes did the
work, but at the end of that time the old man
fell backward, and Tom Booker caught him in
his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shot,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. The family don&#8217;t seem to have no
luck. If one o&#8217; my gells comes to you, you&#8217;ll
give her a fair chance to shoot straight, won&#8217;t
you, boys?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">WILLIAM</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was during the long waiting time.</p>

<p>The battle of Manassas had been fought
in July, and for months afterward, there was
nothing for us to do. We had failed to assail
Washington, and the enemy was not yet sufficiently
recovered from his demoralization&mdash;the
completest that ever overcame an army&mdash;to
assail us.</p>

<p>We had time, therefore, to quarrel among
ourselves.</p>

<p>Two men had met in a glade in a thicket
some distance from the camp. They were taking
their quarrel very seriously, and had met
to fight it out without the formality of seconds
or other familiar frills of the duello. They
crossed sabres.</p>

<p>It was then that Billy Gresham broke through
the bushes and interposed.</p>

<p>Billy was a recognized &#8220;character.&#8221; He was a
phenomenal egotist, but he rarely used the first
personal pronoun singular. Instead of saying
&#8220;I&#8221; or &#8220;me,&#8221; he usually said &#8220;William.&#8221; But
he said it with an unctuousness and appreciation
of its significance that cannot be described in
words.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Also Billy Gresham always did what he
pleased, without a thought of having to give
an account of his conduct to anybody. His
extraordinary loquacity was a perfect safeguard
against any possible challenge of resentment.
He could talk anybody down and close the
conversation at his own sweet will. The worst
that his adversary could do was to laugh at
him, and Billy didn&#8217;t mind that in the least.
He regarded it rather as a grateful tribute to
his humor.</p>

<p>Just as the two men crossed swords, Billy
broke through the bushes, and interposed his
blade&mdash;with a very good imitation of stage
heroism&mdash;between the combatants. Then, with
all the authority of an expert in a matter he
knew nothing about, he proceeded to lay down
laws of his own extemporaneous invention for
the governance of single combat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, gentlemen!&#8221; he cried out. Then,
laying his sword on the ground between them,
he said: &#8220;You must not cross my sword with
yours, gentlemen. To do that would be to put
an affront upon William which only blood could
efface, and it must be the blood of the offender&mdash;not
the gore of private William Gresham.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men had come to a pause, of course.
Equally of course, they were smiling at the
ridiculousness of Billy Gresham&#8217;s interference
and the absurdity of his chatter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Still their purpose to fight remained in undiminished
intensity. Seeing this, Billy resumed
his talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are determined to fight,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;you can do so. Far be it from William to
interrupt a prearranged engagement for mutual
dissection between two of his friends. But
William always likes to have a little money up
on the probabilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then pulling out a pocket-book, which was
fat with humorous newspaper clippings, but
which both men knew to contain nothing more
valuable, he caressed it lovingly and said:
&#8220;Before you proceed, William wants to bet
one hundred dollars to ten with one or both
of you&mdash;you can make it a thousand dollars
to a hundred, if you prefer&mdash;that neither of
you two sublimated idiots can give William
a reasonable excuse for this quarrel. Come
now, before you enter upon the business of
mutual slaughter, make a bet that will provide
in some degree for the loved ones dependent
on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>By that time both men were laughing, for,
after all, their quarrel was a trifling one. They
would not have quarrelled at all if the intensity
of the nervous strain put upon them by the
war had been relieved by active duty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;William has another bet
to make. He offers a hundred to one that if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the colonel catches you fellows at this sort of
idiotic performance, he&#8217;ll take the &#8216;honor&#8217; out
of both of you by making you grub stumps for
weeks to come. Put up your swords and shake
hands, or else take the bets.&#8221;</p>

<p>The absurdity of the situation ended it. Billy
remarked: &#8220;Now let William give you a tip.
There is the enemy to fight; and if William
does not hopelessly misunderstand the temper
of George B. McClellan&#8217;s army, they will give
us all the fighting we want without anything
of this sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Billy who, at the end of the war,
protested his loyalty to the Southern cause by
vowing that he would never send a letter unless
it could go under cover of a Southern
postage-stamp. I am credibly informed that
for thirty odd years he has kept this vow.</p>

<p>It must have spared him a great deal of
trouble.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A CRADLE CAPTAIN</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THEY said we had robbed the cradle and
the grave to recruit our army.</p>

<p>We had.</p>

<p>The cradle contingent acquitted itself particularly
well.</p>

<p>He was a very little fellow. He was said to
be fourteen years old. He didn&#8217;t look it. In
his captain&#8217;s uniform he suggested the need of
a nurse with cap and apron. But when it
came to doing the work of a soldier the impression
was different.</p>

<p>It was in 1864, late summer. We were in
the trenches outside a fortification engaged in
bombarding Fort Harrison, below Richmond.
The enemy had captured that work, and it was
deemed necessary to drive him out. To that
end we had been sent from Petersburg to the
north side of James River, with twenty-two
mortars to rain a hundred shells a minute into
the fort preparatory to the infantry charge.</p>

<p>A gun-boat had been ordered up the river to
help in the bombardment. The gun-boat mistook
<i>us</i> for Fort Harrison and opened upon
our defenceless rear. Its shells were about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
size and shape of a street lamp, and they
wrought fearful havoc among us.</p>

<p>The Cradle Captain had charge of the signal
operator&mdash;a stalwart mountaineer of six feet
four or so.</p>

<p>The Cradle Captain ordered him to mount
upon the glacis and signal the ship to cease
firing. The man was not a coward; but the
fire was terrific. He hesitated. That Cradle
Captain leaped like a cat upon the glacis, which
the shells were splitting every second. He
pulled out two pistols. He presented one at
each side of the mountaineer&#8217;s head. Then in
a little, childish, piping voice he said: &#8220;Get up
here and do your duty, or I&#8217;ll blow your brains
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>We rejoiced that the lead, which at that
moment laid the little soldier low, came from
the enemy&#8217;s guns, and not from our own mistaken
comrades. The Cradle Captain was glad,
too, for as he was carried away on a litter, he
laughed out between groans: &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t our
men that did it, for I had made that hulking
idiot get in that signal all right, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">WHO IS RUSSELL?</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;SAW him for the first time in 1862.</p>

<p>We were stationed on the coast of South
Carolina, and never was there an idler set of
soldiers than we.</p>

<p>We were in the midst of a great war, it is
true, and ours was a fighting battery with dates
on its battle banner; but on the coast we had
literally nothing to do. The position of our
camp was determined by military geography,
and it could not be changed. A fight was possible
any day, and now and then a fight came.
But we knew in advance precisely where it
must be waged, and until our foemen chose to
bring it about, we had no occasion for marching
or bivouacking. They were on the sea
islands. We were on the mainland. We had
no means of crossing to the islands. They
could cross to the mainland whenever they
pleased. When they came, it was our business
to meet them and keep them from reaching
the line of railroad along the coast.</p>

<p>Every little stream and every little inlet was
bordered by an impassable morass, which
could be crossed only by way of a high and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
narrow causeway. The places where the roads
crossed the streams were, therefore, the predestined
battlefields. We were stationed with
reference to these crossings.</p>

<p>We idled away the time, and like all idle
people near a small railroad station we knew
of the comings and goings of everybody in the
country round about.</p>

<p>Everybody, that is to say, except Russell.</p>

<p>His coming was a mystery. In fact, he did
not come at all. He simply appeared one
evening as a looker-on at roll-call.</p>

<p>There was no way by which he could have
come to Pocotaligo except by train; and we
knew that he had not come by train. The
whole body of us regularly attended the incoming
of every train, and promptly pumped
all the news out of every arriving passenger.</p>

<p>Russell had not come by train. Therefore
Russell had not come at all. Yet there he was.</p>

<p>He was a comely young fellow. So shapely
were his limbs and so exact the proportions of
his frame that no one, without a second look at
him, would have realized his symmetry, his extraordinary
strength, or his activity. His head
was a study for the sculptor. In limbs, torso,
features, complexion, and bearing he stood there
in the Southern sunset a very model of manly
beauty.</p>

<p>When the roll-call was ended, he came up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
me, and, touching his hat gracefully, introduced
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is William Russell. I shall be
obliged if you will let me remain with your
men over night. I shall probably ask to enlist
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>His words were simple enough, and his manner
was that of a modest gentleman; but there
was that in his voice that fascinated me beyond
measure. Had any other stranger come up to
me with a like request, I should have questioned
him closely, and possibly have turned
him over for the night to the hospitality of one
of the messes. With Russell I did nothing of
the sort. He was a gentleman visiting our
camp. I could do no less than invite him to
sup and lodge with me. He had sought no
such hospitality, but when I offered it, he
frankly accepted it.</p>

<p>I found him to be a particularly agreeable
guest. He talked fluently, but modestly, on all
subjects as they arose. Before my brother
officers came into my quarters for our nightly
game of whist, I had discovered that Russell
was not only a man of broad general education,
but one thoroughly familiar with English, German,
and French literature as well. We learned
very indirectly that he had travelled extensively,
and that travel had wrought in him its perfect
work in making him an agreeable companion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>The next morning he expressed a wish to
enlist with us. He persisted in this, in spite
of our assurances that our rude, uncultivated
mountaineers were not fit companions for him.</p>

<p>After his enlistment he carefully avoided
everything like presumption upon our previous
hospitality, or upon his own evident superiority.
He knew the distinction between officers and
enlisted men, and he observed it with a rigidity
wholly unknown in our rather democratic service.
I was glad sometimes to seek him out
when I wanted a companion, and on such occasions
he responded promptly to my invitations,
but he never once came to my quarters,
or those of any other officer, uninvited.</p>

<p>He was always quiet and modest, and it was
only by accident that we learned little by little
how many and varied his accomplishments were.
It was not only that he never boasted; he was
even shy of letting us find out for ourselves
how many things he could do surprisingly
well.</p>

<p>The men had built a number of gymnastic
structures, and of afternoons their contests of
strength and skill were attended by everybody
in the neighborhood. For more than a month
Russell looked on as a casually interested spectator.
One afternoon, however, some of our
best gymnasts were trying to accomplish a
new and rather difficult feat. When they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
ready to abandon the attempt as hopeless, Russell
modestly said to the most persistent one
among them: &#8220;I think if you will reverse the
position of your hands you can do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man reversed his hands, but awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that way; let me show you,&#8221; said
Russell. And going to the bars he quickly
did the thing himself with no apparent exertion
whatever. Then, as if in mere wantonness
of strength and skill, he went rapidly through
a series of gymnastic feats of the most difficult
sort imaginable, ending the performance with a
number of somersaults that would have done
honor to an acrobat. When he had done, we
all clapped hands and shouted our applause.
Russell simply blushed as a woman might and
went to his hut.</p>

<p>I never knew him to touch the bars again,
so averse was he to anything like display.</p>

<p>When I ventured to ask him in private one
day how and where he had acquired his skill,
he replied: &#8220;Oh, I have no skill to speak of
in the matter. It&#8217;s merely a trick or two I
picked up at a German university.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this way we learned one thing after another
about the man, though he vouchsafed us no information
concerning his past history, except so
much as we had discovered in mustering him
into service. That consisted of but one fact:
that William Russell was born in Kentucky;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
and that isolated fact was a falsehood, as Russell
afterwards informed me.</p>

<p>One day, some months after his enlistment,
there was an explosion in camp.</p>

<p>A chief of caisson had been tinkering with a
shell from the enemy&#8217;s camp which had not
burst. It exploded in his hands, literally blowing
one of them off midway between the wrist
and the elbow. When I came to the poor fellow
he was lying on the ground, the blood
spurting from the severed artery.</p>

<p>The surgeon and all my brother officers had
ridden away, no one knew whither, and I was
completely at a loss to know what to do. Before
I had time to decide anything, Russell pushed
his way through the throng, drew out his handkerchief,
knotted it, and quickly tightened it
around the man&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you please hold that steadily?&#8221; said
he in the calmest possible voice to one of the
excited men. Then turning to me and touching
his cap, he said: &#8220;Will you allow me to go to
the surgeon&#8217;s quarters for some necessary
things? I think I may help this poor fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;if you can do anything
for him, do it by all means.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked rapidly, but without a sign of excitement,
to the hospital tent, and returned
almost immediately with some bottles, bandages,
and a case of instruments.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Turning to me he said: &#8220;Will you do me the
favor to put your finger on the corporal&#8217;s pulse
and observe its beating carefully? If it sinks
or becomes irregular, please let me know immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he saturated a handkerchief with
chloroform, and using a peremptory form of
speech for the first time in my experience of
him, he ordered one of the men to hold it to the
wounded corporal&#8217;s nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; I asked in
astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to amputate this man&#8217;s arm, if
you have no objection,&#8221; he returned, as he
opened the case of instruments. And he did
amputate it in a most skilful manner, as the
surgeon testified on his return. The operation
over, Russell gave minute directions for the care
of the wounded man.</p>

<p>My astonishment may well be imagined. The
men, however, were not surprised. Their faith
in Russell was unbounded already. They had
so often seen him do as an expert things that
nobody had imagined him capable of doing at
all, that they had come to think him equal to
any emergency, as indeed it seemed that he
was.</p>

<p>For myself, I am free to confess that my
curiosity was sharply piqued. I determined to
question Russell in detail about himself and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
past at the first opportunity. When the opportunity
came, however, the man&#8217;s modest dignity
so impressed me that I could not bring myself
to do anything so rude and discourteous. I
contented myself with saying: &#8220;Why, Russell,
I didn&#8217;t know you were a surgeon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly claim to be that,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;though I gave some little attention to the subject
while I was abroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>It then occurred to me to suggest the propriety
of his asking for a surgeon&#8217;s commission,
as it really seemed a pity that a man so accomplished
as he should remain a private in a
company made up almost entirely of illiterate
mountaineers. He refused to entertain the idea
for a moment, saying: &#8220;I am entirely contented
with my lot and do not care to change.&#8221;</p>

<p>One day, not long after this occurrence, I
was playing at chess with Russell. Apropos
of something or other, I told him an anecdote
illustrative of Japanese character.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but you are misinformed,&#8221;
and straightway he proceeded to tell
me many interesting facts with regard to the
Orientals, all of which were evidently the result
of personal observation. I presently discovered,
as I thought, that Russell had been an officer in
the United States navy, and that he had gone
to Japan with Commodore Perry&#8217;s expedition.</p>

<p>When a month or two later our battery was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
sent to a little place immediately on the water,
and a good deal of boat service was expected of
us, our first care was to train our mountaineers
in the use of oars and sails. With the exception
of Russell, Joe, and myself, not a man in
the battery knew the difference between a mast
and a keel. It was determined, therefore, to
divide the company into boat&#8217;s crews for drill,
and to make of Russell chief drill sergeant.</p>

<p>When the order providing for this was read
on parade, Russell said nothing. But I had
hardly reached my quarters before he came,
cap in hand, asking to see me in private.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must beg you to excuse me from this boat-drill
duty; I really can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must,&#8221; I returned. &#8220;The men
must be taught to handle the boats, and your
skill and experience are quite indispensable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have no skill or experience in the
matter,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;The truth is I do not
even know the nomenclature of a boat. I do
know the bow from the rudder, but that is the
extreme limit of my knowledge on the subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, from an ex-naval officer, was certainly
rather odd, but I could not bring myself to
question this modest gentleman further on the
subject, or even to suspect his veracity, in
which I had learned to repose the most implicit
confidence.</p>

<p>He was not at all averse to boating duty in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
itself. On the contrary, when an oar was put
into his hands, his supple muscles lent themselves
with a will to the severe physical strain.
The man seemed even to rejoice in the opportunity
thus given him to bring his magnificent
strength into play. When his fellows quitted
the boats in utter weariness he, still fresh, would
betake himself to a little shell and row her
about for hours in mere wantonness of unexpended
vitality.</p>

<p>But he knew nothing of boating. He was
as awkward as possible at first. He learned
rapidly, however, and soon became a graceful
oarsman and an expert sailor.</p>

<p>I was puzzled. I could not reconcile the
man&#8217;s stories of naval service with his evident
ignorance of everything pertaining to a boat.
Yet I could not doubt the truthfulness of any
of his statements. Nobody who knew his gentleness,
his modesty, and his translucent integrity
as I did could possibly entertain doubt of
his truthfulness. The man&#8217;s face was of itself
a certificate of his entire trustworthiness. His
conduct and his manners were unexceptionable
always. The man himself was the embodiment
of truth.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when I observed some tattoo
marks on his arm one day, which he told me
were put there while he was in the navy, it did
not occur to me to question him as to the truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
of that story. On the contrary, I thought at the
moment of a possible explanation of the whole
matter: Perhaps he had been a surgeon in the
service, and if so his technical ignorance of
boating was not altogether unaccountable. I
was surprised, however, to see that the letters
on his arm were not &#8220;W. R.&#8221; but &#8220;W. W.&#8221;&mdash;a
fact of which he volunteered an explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is not Russell,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
Wallace. Though for a good many years I
have preferred to use my mother&#8217;s rather than
my father&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a matter of course I asked him no rude
questions. He was altogether too much a gentleman
for me to think of such a thing. I accepted
his explanation and respected his wish
to be called &#8220;Russell&#8221; still. He imposed no
pledge of secrecy upon me, but I kept his
secret sacredly, respecting it as a confidential
communication from one gentleman to another.</p>

<p>I had hardly settled it in my own mind that
Russell&#8217;s connection with the navy had been in
the capacity of a surgeon, when he came one
day with the request that he might be allowed
to go to Charleston for the purpose of standing
an examination for admission to the navy as an
officer.</p>

<p>This time, I confess, I was astonished. And
so I went with him to Charleston and before
the board. To my surprise, he passed his examination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
so brilliantly, that he was commissioned
at once and put in command of a newly
built gun-boat. Shortly afterwards he handled
his vessel so well in a fight off the harbor
as to secure an official compliment and a promotion.</p>

<p>About a week after that event I learned that
he had deserted the navy and was among the
missing. Apparently the poor fellow was a
man running away from his past, and nothing
was so disastrous to him as distinction.</p>

<p>I thus lost sight of Russell, and until August,
1873, I heard no more of him. I was editing a
weekly family newspaper in New York at that
time, and oddly enough I was just beginning to
write this sketch of my singular acquaintance
when Russell himself walked into my office at
245 Broadway and asked me if I remembered
him. He was well dressed, in a quiet drab suit,
and was scarcely at all changed. He told me
that he was married and was living at a certain
number in West 43d Street; that he was practising
law, being senior member of the firm of
Wintermute and Russell, for that his real name
was Wintermute, and that his partner, Russell,
was a cousin on the mother&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>He gave me the firm&#8217;s card, and begged me
to call upon him, both at his house and at his
office, which of course I promised to do.</p>

<p>I called first at the house. It was a well-built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
one of pressed brick, and seemed to wear
something of Russell&#8217;s own air of quiet dignity,
standing as it did in a row of more pretentious
brown-stone mansions. The door-plate&mdash;for
door-plates were then still in use&mdash;bore the
simple word, &#8220;Wintermute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Wintermute at home?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Commander Wintermute is in his library,&#8221;
answered the lackey, laying special stress upon
the naval title.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, certainly, Commander Wintermute,&#8221; I
answered. &#8220;I had forgotten. Will you give
him my card? I am an old friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was shown into the parlor,&mdash;a conspicuously
tasteful apartment,&mdash;furnished exactly as
I should have expected Russell to furnish it.</p>

<p>After a little the door opened, and an elderly
gentleman, obviously English, entered, holding
my card in a puzzled way before his spectacled
nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The servant must
have misunderstood you. He announced you
as an old friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I asked for Commander
Wintermute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am he,&#8221; replied the gentleman. &#8220;Though
I certainly fail to recognize either your name or
your face. There must be a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There certainly seems to be,&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;unless there is another gentleman in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
family. The one I am seeking is William
Wintermute, whose mother&#8217;s name was Russell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I am certainly the man,&#8221; responded
my companion. &#8220;My name is William Wintermute
and my mother&#8217;s name was Russell. There
is no other gentleman living in the house, and
so far as I have ever heard there is no other
William Wintermute anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done except to
apologize and take my leave, which I did as
gracefully as I could under the circumstances.</p>

<p>At last I was angry with Russell. I had been
puzzled by him often enough. This time I was
filled with resentment.</p>

<p>I at once sought out the law office of Wintermute
and Russell. The card, which I had preserved,
gave me all necessary information as to
its whereabouts, and I was not long in finding it.
Mr. Wintermute was there. So was Mr. Russell.
But neither was the man for whom I was looking.
Neither had ever heard of him.</p>

<p>I was still left puzzling over these questions:&mdash;</p>

<p>Who is Russell?</p>

<p>Is he after all a liar?</p>

<p>Or is he merely a remarkable coincidence?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In June or July, 1874, I published the foregoing
sketch in a little monthly magazine printed
in an obscure college town in Illinois, which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
a circulation of only a few hundred copies, and
lived just five months in all.</p>

<p>It was called the <i>Midland Monthly Magazine</i>,
and was issued by a student in the college at
Monmouth, Illinois.</p>

<p>Everything that related to Russell was sure
in some way to blossom out with all sorts of
strange coincidences. This did so. In spite
of the obscure way in which my account of the
man was published, I had no doubt whatever
that it would sooner or later result in some new
revelation of or concerning him.</p>

<p>It did so, of course.</p>

<p>The obscure student&#8217;s magazine somehow
found its way to Bordentown, New Jersey, and
into the hands of an editor there. The editor
was impressed by the story and reprinted it.
It thus fell into the hands of the Reverend
Lansing Burroughs, pastor of the First Baptist
Church of that town, and late captain of Confederate
States Artillery.</p>

<p>I was not surprised when I received from the
Reverend Lansing Burroughs, etc., the following
letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bordentown</span>, N. J., Sept. 5, 1874.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>: I have just finished reading a sketch
published over your name (copied from somewhere, I suppose)
in our local paper, entitled &#8220;Who is Russell?&#8221; It
petrifies me with astonishment. For thirteen years past
the question which has bothered me most seriously has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
been, &#8220;Who is Russell?&#8221; alias &#8220;Wallace,&#8221; alias &#8220;Wintermute,&#8221;
for by all these and some other names have I
known the mysterious individual. If you have been writing
only a fancy sketch, I must tackle one of the strangest
problems in mental philosophy. If your story is one of
experience, then must I see you and compare notes. I
fancy I can horrify you with the story of what Russell
once told me had been his history....</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Yours very truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Lansing Burroughs</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Pastor of the First Baptist Church, Bordentown, N. J.
Late captain Confederate States Artillery</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Now it was just like Russell that an account
of him, published in a short-lived magazine, of a
purely local circulation, out in Illinois, should
in some inscrutable way have fallen into the
hands of the editor of a little country paper in
New Jersey; that this editor should have copied
it into his paper; and that one of his readers
should happen to be the one other man in existence
who was puzzling over the questions with
which the sketch ended.</p>

<p>But this was not all. There was still another
coincidence. There was that in my correspondent&#8217;s
letter which revealed to me a fact of which
he was apparently unconscious; namely, that
this Reverend Lansing Burroughs was an old
college mate of my own, whom I had not seen
or heard from for sixteen years. Such a coincidence
was altogether natural and proper, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
growing as it did out of matters connected
with Russell.</p>

<p>I had some further correspondence with the
Reverend Mr. Burroughs, and finally we met by
appointment and went to Mouquin&#8217;s for luncheon
and to compare notes. A careful analysis
of dates proved beyond doubt that <i>his</i>
Russell was <i>my</i> Russell. But our experiences
were of a very different sort. Mr. Burroughs
had never once had a meeting with the mysterious
man which did not bring calamity of some
sort upon himself. So far as I was concerned,
no ill beyond annoyance and embarrassment
had ever come of my acquaintance with him.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Burroughs declares to me
his firm conviction that the quiet, singularly
shy, well-behaved, modest gentleman, so unusually
gifted, especially in the way of a phenomenal
genius for lying, is in plain terms <span class="allsmcap">THE
DEVIL</span>.</p>

<p>As to this, Mr. Burroughs is by profession
an expert, and I am not. I therefore venture
no opinion. I merely continue to ask, &#8220;Who
is Russell?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">&#8220;JUANITA&#8221;</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;WAS on guard one night in the autumn of
1861.</p>

<p>It was only ordinary camp guard and not
picket duty.</p>

<p>We had fallen back from the line of Mason&#8217;s
and Munson&#8217;s hills, and were camped well in
the rear of Fairfax Court House, which now
constituted our most advanced outpost.</p>

<p>The army were fortified at Centreville. We
had got tired of waiting for McClellan to make
the advance for which we were so eagerly
ready. We were evidently preparing to go
into winter quarters.</p>

<p>We of Stuart&#8217;s cavalry were still posted six
or eight miles in advance of the main army;
but after our summer, passed twenty miles in
front, we felt snug and comfortable at &#8220;Camp
Cooper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when I saw three rockets&mdash;red,
white, and blue&mdash;go up far to the front, it
occurred to me that the fact might mean something.</p>

<p>At any rate, I was lonely on post. I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
sung &#8220;Juanita&#8221; under my breath,&mdash;and that it
wasn&#8217;t permitted to sing out loud on post was
probably a rule not made with any invidious
reference to my voice, though it might well have
been,&mdash;I say I had sung &#8220;Juanita&#8221; under my
breath till I had exhausted the capabilities of
entertainment that reside in that tender musical
composition.</p>

<p>So, for the sake of diversion, if for nothing
else, I called out: &#8220;Corporal of the guard, post
number six.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the corporal came and I reported what
I had seen, he moodily growled something about
there being no orders to &#8220;report on Yankee
fireworks.&#8221; Nevertheless, he communicated
my report to higher authority.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later a hurried messenger
came, summoning me at once to General Stuart&#8217;s
headquarters, half a mile in front.</p>

<p>Mounting, I rode at a gallop. That was the
only gait which Stuart tolerated, except in going
<i>away</i> from the enemy.</p>

<p>As I rode out of camp I heard &#8220;Boots and
Saddles&#8221; sounded from all the bugles of all the
regiments.</p>

<p>I knew then that &#8220;something was up.&#8221;
&#8220;Boots and Saddles&#8221; always meant something
when Stuart gave the order.</p>

<p>When I dismounted at headquarters, Stuart
himself was waiting, although it was three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
o&#8217;clock in the morning. His plume and golden
spurs gleamed through the dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me quick!&#8221; was all he had to say. I
answered sententiously: &#8220;Three rockets went
up: red to right, white to left, and blue in the
middle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean <i>our</i> right and left, or the enemy&#8217;s?&#8221;
he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ours,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>He turned quickly and gave hurried orders
to staff-officers, orderlies, and couriers. Then
turning to me, he said: &#8220;<i>You ride with me.</i>&#8221; I
appreciated the attention.</p>

<p>Five minutes later a great column of cavalrymen
were riding at a gallop towards the front.
And just as daylight dawned we broke into a
charge upon a heavy force of the enemy.</p>

<p>The hostile force was slowly advancing, not
expecting us, and we struck it in flank, taking
it completely by surprise.</p>

<p>The demoralization of the Manassas, or Bull
Run panic had not even yet gone out of the
Northern troops. We made short work of their
advance and sent them quickly into disorderly
retreat.</p>

<p>One of Stuart&#8217;s couriers was killed in the
charge. I remember, because he rode beside
me, and his head fell clean from his body, and
the sight sickened me, so that I fought harder
for the minute than I thought I could.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>As the enemy broke, Stuart stopped his horse,
slapped his thigh, and turning to me laughing,
and with that indifference to rank which always
characterized him under excitement, exclaimed:
&#8220;They haven&#8217;t got over it yet, have they?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Manassas panic always did impress
Stuart as an irresistible joke.</p>

<p>A moment later he said: &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you reported
those rockets. Always report whatever
you see. Even a shooting star may mean something
at headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I have never ceased to wonder why we
guards that night had no orders to look out for
red, white, and blue rockets, since they meant
so much. If they had not been reported by
a tired and lonely sentinel, we should have been
run over in our tents by a force of ten thousand
men.</p>

<p>A celebrated writer says: &#8220;War is a hazard
of possibilities, probabilities, luck, and ill luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was luck that night that a sentry was tired
of singing &#8220;Juanita&#8221; under his breath.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCRUGGS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SCRUGGS lived throughout the war in that
debatable land between the lines in Northern
Virginia, where it was always a wonder
that anybody could live at all.</p>

<p>And Scruggs lived well, too. He was not
able to work, because in order to keep out of
the army he had found or feigned a physical
disability of some kind.</p>

<p>We always knew that we could get accurate
information concerning the enemy by going to
Scruggs for it. He frequented their camps as
freely as he did ours. He kept his eyes open.
He always knew all the important facts, and he
was always eager to tell them.</p>

<p>When we went after this information Scruggs
was sure to be nowhere visible, and none of his
family could ever tell where he might be. But
after he had had opportunity to find out with
certainty to which side we belonged, Scruggs
would come out of his hiding-place, and tell us
precisely at what points the enemy was encamped,
what his strength was, and what his
disposition to activity appeared to be.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>Then he would tell us how nearly his family
were starving by reason of the fact that the
enemy had raided his place and carried off all
his supplies. In common gratitude we could
do nothing less than replenish his larder with
whatever we might happen to possess.</p>

<p>Scruggs&#8217;s information was always accurate,
always full, and always scrupulously truthful.</p>

<p>When a party of the enemy went up to
Scruggs&#8217;s to inquire about us, Scruggs pursued
precisely the same policy. First making sure
to which side the party belonged, he would
come forth and tell all that he knew with regard
to the position and strength of our posts;
he would add that little piece of misinformation,&mdash;most
precious to him,&mdash;that we had
stripped him bare of sustenance, and they
would generously relieve his necessities again.</p>

<p>In all this Scruggs was scrupulously truthful,
except for the little lie about provisions, and
it was all absolutely impartial. If such virtues
count for anything in war, Scruggs was entitled
to full credit for them.</p>

<p>But one day our commander grew suspicious
of Scruggs. On the same day the commander
of the Federal outposts began also to suspect
Scruggs.</p>

<p>After a little investigation our commandant
made up his mind to hang Scruggs for a spy.
About the same time the Federal commandant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
after a like investigation, came to a similar determination
with regard to Scruggs.</p>

<p>The two hanging parties met at Scruggs&#8217;s
house. As usual, Scruggs was not there. But
the two parties engaged each other at once.
They were about of equal numbers, and they
fought valiantly for a time, neither understanding,
of course, that they were there on precisely
similar errands.</p>

<p>After a little our party began to doubt whether
Scruggs was worth the contest or not, and retired
a little way. The Federals, with a like
contempt for Scruggs, retired about the same
distance. After a few shots at long range both
parties went back to their camps, each commander
feeling that, &#8220;After all, Scruggs has
never failed to give us all the information he
could, and has never yet deceived us on a single
point.&#8221;</p>

<p>After both parties had gone Scruggs came
out of his hiding-place and remarked to his
eldest daughter: &#8220;You see, Prudence, what it is
for a feller to be always truthful.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, by the way, Scruggs never did get
himself hanged.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">JOE ON HORSEBACK</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">JOE was not quite seventeen years old.
He could ride anything that happened to
possess a back. He therefore had a great love
for his horse&mdash;the noblest one in the battery.</p>

<p>During the preliminary skirmish in advance of
Pocotaligo, on that terrible 22d of October, 1862,
his gun detachment was cut to pieces in a fearful
way, until he had to work his piece with three
men, serving as a cannoneer himself. When
we retired from the skirmish line at Yemassee to
Pocotaligo proper, and it was obvious that we
must fight enormous odds in order to prevent
the enemy from crossing the causeway we were
defending, I suggested to Joe that he dismount,
as the rest of us had done, and take to a tree.</p>

<p>Joe resented the suggestion with the remark:
&#8220;My place is on horseback. I&#8217;m a sergeant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two minutes later a cannon-ball carried away
his horse&#8217;s tail. Five seconds afterwards another
cannon-ball carried off the beast&#8217;s left
forefoot. Feeling that the horse was sinking
under him, Joe dismounted to see what the
damage had been. As he stooped to look at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the dismembered foot, still another cannon-ball
passed just over his head, split his saddle, and
broke the poor animal&#8217;s back. Thereupon Joe
turned, presented his pistol at the horse&#8217;s head,
averted his eyes and fired.</p>

<p>Then he took a horse out of the battery and
mounted him, remarking: &#8220;I still contend that
as a sergeant my place is on horseback.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy was crying, but none of us made
remark upon the incongruity.</p>

<p>Joe was mentioned in general orders for his
gallantry that day, but the fact had no reference
to this matter of the horse.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A RATHER BAD NIGHT</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WE were living in the deserted village.
That is to say, our battery of light
artillery was stationed at Bluffton, South Carolina.</p>

<p>At ordinary times Bluffton had a population
of about three thousand souls. At the time of
which I write it had no population at all.</p>

<p>It was a town built upon a high bluff overlooking
an arm of the sea, or more properly a
great bay, broken by multitudinous islands into
various inlets. Hilton Head lay within sight,
twelve miles away, and all the waters of the
great island-studded bay were navigable.</p>

<p>Bluffton never had any business to do. It
had no shops, no factories, no anything but
planters&#8217; residences. Its houses were all elegant
and all comfortable. Its streets were
shaded by great spreading trees, not planted in
symmetrical rows, but growing wherever they
pleased, in the midst of the thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Bluffton was exposed to the direct assault of
gun-boats or expeditions of any sort. So, early
in the war, its entire population left and went to
points in the interior. At the time I write of,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
in 1863, there was not a soul in the town except
the men of the battery to which I belonged.</p>

<p>Our captain was commandant of outposts. I
was adjutant of the same.</p>

<p>Our support consisted of two or three small
troops of cavalry. Their camps were several
miles in rear of our own. These cavalrymen
did all the picketing. In the event of an attack
we and they were charged with the duty of
harassing the advance of the enemy and delaying
him on his march to the railroad, seventeen
miles away, long enough for troops to be sent
down from Charleston or up from Savannah.</p>

<p>It was a wild, free, gypsy-like life. We lived
in the handsomely furnished houses, made free
use of the very rich libraries, fished, played at
chess, shot deer and turkeys in the woods, dozed
upon &#8220;joggling boards&#8221; in sea-breeze-swept
piazzas, and altogether did nothing most industriously
and delightfully.</p>

<p>There was one duty to be done, and that a
very important one. It was necessary for some
officer to make the grand rounds of the pickets
every night. This task devolved upon me about
once a week. The pickets were stationed at all
available points of observation below, all points
from which the channels could be seen. To
visit them required an all night&#8217;s ride, which in
that country is by no means an agreeable undertaking.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>The weeds rise above the head of a horseman,
and the dew drips as rain might, from every leaf.
The night rider becomes water soaked and chilled
to the very bones, even during the fierce summer
weather. During the autumn and winter a
night ride on this subtropical coast brings with
it a degree of suffering from cold which the
fiercest Northern winter never produces.</p>

<p>But it was absolutely necessary to visit the
picket posts. Upon their efficiency depended
our safety and that of the railroad we were set to
defend. If a single picket slept, a fleet of gun-boats
or ship&#8217;s launches might come to Bluffton
wholly unannounced. The battery, without
support at hand, would fall helpless into the
enemy&#8217;s hands, and the railroad communication,
on which the safety of Charleston and Savannah
depended, would be broken.</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve, crisp and cool. A
heap of fat hard pine was blazing in the great
fireplace in our quarters. The negro servant
was busy in the kitchen without. Our guests,
half a dozen officers from the cavalry companies,
were already assembled. We had invited them
to dine with us upon a haunch of venison, a
wild turkey, fish, oysters, crabs, shrimps, etc.,
all of which, except the first two, could be
taken at any time within a hundred yards of
the door. Our little party-giving promised to
be a thoroughly successful bit of hospitality.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Curry, the cook, had just begun to put the
dinner on the table when a messenger came to
report that Lieutenant C&mdash;&mdash;, the officer appointed
to make the picket rounds that night,
was ill and could not go. It was my turn next
and there was no escape. At the holiday season
pickets especially need watching. I knew very
well it would never do to leave them unvisited
that night. There was nothing for it, therefore,
but to turn the guests over to my messmate,
the captain, and order my horse.</p>

<p>My guide&mdash;for without a guide no one could
possibly find his way at night through parts of
that country&mdash;was a dull, taciturn fellow, with
whom I found it impossible to maintain a conversation.
My twelve miles&#8217; ride to the farthest
picket post, which I visited first, was therefore
a very disagreeable substitute for the jovial,
social evening I had planned.</p>

<p>By the time I had reached Bear&#8217;s Island, I
was wet to the skin with dew and stiff with cold.
It was about ten o&#8217;clock when we rode across
the causeway from the mainland to the island,
and the first thing I observed was the utter
darkness of the place. Ordinarily the pickets
on this post kept up a little fire behind a screen
at which to warm and dry themselves during the
night. Approaching from the rear, I always
saw this fire when I crossed the causeway, the
screen standing between it and the water on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
other side. To-night, however, everything was
dark, and it was with some little difficulty that
we found our way across the island to the picket
post.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, sergeant?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s your fire to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to put it out and move away from
it,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;They are loading up two gun-boats
and three transports just across the creek
there, and they threw two or three charges of
grape-shot over here an hour or two ago. They
killed one of my men, poor fellow. I&#8217;ve been
watching them and was on the point of sending
a man up with the alarm. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve come
to take the responsibility off my shoulders.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time I had brought my glass to bear
upon the pier upon the other side of the inlet,
or creek, as it is commonly called, and saw that
the sergeant was right. Three transports were
rapidly receiving troops, cavalry, artillery, and
infantry, while two rather formidable looking
gun-boats were sullenly steaming up and down
in front.</p>

<p>The inlet was nearly a mile wide, and as the
enemy showed few lights and dim ones, the sergeant
without a glass had not been able to discover
the number of troops taken on board. I
soon made out that at least five field batteries
had been shipped, and that the transports were
almost full of troops, while a battalion of infantry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
a squadron of cavalry, and two batteries remained
on shore, apparently waiting for those
on board to be so disposed as to afford room for
them.</p>

<p>I rapidly weighed all the probabilities in my
mind. There were two and only two possible
purposes in this embarkation of troops. It was
a formidable expedition against the railroad, via
Bluffton, or else it was merely a removal of troops
from one point on the coast to another. If the
first were the object, the vessels would steam up
the inlet; if the other, they would put to sea.</p>

<p>But if it were merely a transfer of troops,
why were the transports crowded in this way,
and why were the convoying gun-boats there?
There was no enemy off the coast, except
storms; and as storms were conspicuously disregarded
in the overloading of the steamers,
it seemed to me clear that the expedition was
bound for Bluffton.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;How many men have you, sergeant?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trusty fellows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As good as ever threw a leg over a saddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send them to me,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>When they came, I asked: &#8220;Are your horses
good ones?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty good.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;Mount, then,&#8221; I said to one, &#8220;and ride as
fast as you can to Buckingham Ferry. Wait
with the pickets there till the fleet comes within
sight. Then send a man to Bluffton to announce
the fact. Stay yourself till the fleet
has passed, observing which creek it takes.
As soon as you satisfy yourself on that point,
ride to Bluffton and report.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then turning to the other, I said: &#8220;You go
to Hunting Island and do the same thing. Tell
the sergeants there to follow their standing orders
in all other regards. Be quick, now, both
of you. I&#8217;ll expect you at Bluffton at the right
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the men galloped away, I walked to the
place where the sergeant was still standing,
and said: &#8220;Sergeant, you and I will stay here
till the fleet leaves. Then we&#8217;ll ride straight
to Bluffton on a full run and give the alarm in
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s already leaving,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;And
look! it&#8217;s steaming straight up the creek.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking, I saw that it was as he said. The
two gun-boats abreast led the column, the three
transports following.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time for us to be riding, then,&#8221; I said,
hastily springing into my saddle. &#8220;But we
can beat them by two hours, as the creek is
crooked and they must sound all the way for
want of buoys.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>We galloped across the island; but when we
came to the little creek we found an unexpected
obstacle in our way. The tide had risen well-nigh
to the flood, and was exceedingly high in
consequence of a strong wind that had been
blowing on shore all day. The strip of marsh
which separated the island from the mainland
was completely covered with water, and even the
causeway leading across it was submerged. The
two men sent to alarm the pickets had reached
the place only a little while earlier than we.
We found them hunting for some landmark or
other by which to find out where the causeway
lay.</p>

<p>The sergeant thought he knew its locality
and direction. He boldly plunged in. The
rest of us followed.</p>

<p>Just what we did, or where we went, or how
it all happened, none of us ever knew. But we
rode off the submerged track, about midway
the stream, and found ourselves floundering in
the water, some of us on our horses, and some
of us under them. It was the darkest night I
ever knew. Once in the water we could see no
shore anywhere. Naturally, each took the direction
in which he thought the desired bank
lay. And it seemed that no two of us agreed
in our views on this point except by accident.</p>

<p>My horse swam pretty well and finally made
the edge of the water. But the bottom was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
quagmire, and sinking in it he could not extricate
himself. To relieve him I slipped off his
back and into the water, but it proved too late.
With every frantic struggle the poor beast sank
deeper, and within a minute he lay lifeless in
the water, half buried in the mud of the bottom.</p>

<p>My own situation was a perilous one. My
feet sank at once in the slimy ooze. To save
myself I threw my body forwards. Succeeding
in freeing my feet, I swam until the water was
too shallow for swimming. After that, by crawling
on my belly, I managed to avoid sinking
and smothering in the mud.</p>

<p>It was half an hour, however, before I stood
upon firm ground again, and then I did not
know which side of the marsh I had reached.</p>

<p>I was covered with slime, stiff with cold, and
utterly exhausted by my exertions. Of myself,
however, I thought little. I was anxious only
about the sleeping battery at Bluffton. If the
alarm were not given,&mdash;and unless some one or
other of our party had succeeded in getting
across with his horse, it could not be,&mdash;Bluffton
would be taken completely by surprise.
The battery would be captured. A rapid march
would take the enemy to the railroad, either at
Grahamville or at Hardeeville, before any force
could be sent to oppose. Our defence of an
essential line of communication would fail.
Even if the two men from the picket post had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
got out on the other side, they would go not to
Bluffton, but to Buckingham Ferry and Hunting
Island, as I had ordered. It was not at all certain
that the fleet would pass either of those
points. It could sail up other creeks quite as
easily, particularly on such a tide as that.</p>

<p>With these thoughts in my mind I felt the
need of bestirring myself. I was not long in discovering
that we were still on the island, and not
on the mainland. Following the margin of the
water, I presently came to the two men who had
been with the sergeant on picket. One of them
was stuck in the mud, and the other was trying
to draw him out with a pole. Both of them had
lost their horses. The sergeant and my guide
had escaped with their steeds, and I found both of
them on the island, a little further up the shore.</p>

<p>The guide was utterly demoralized with fright,
or cold, or both. So I took his horse and
ordered him to wait on the island till morning,
and then to make his way to whatever point he
should find it easiest to reach. The sergeant
and I determined to make another effort to get
to Bluffton and give the alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run back to the other side of the island,&#8221;
said he to one of his men, &#8220;and see if the fleet
is still in sight and what it is doing. We must
let our horses blow a little, and you can get
back by the time we are ready to start.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man went, and his comrade, having nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
better to do, went with him. Presently one
of them returned, bringing the news that the
fleet was making its way up a narrow creek
from which, as we knew, neither the Buckingham
Ferry nor the Hunting Island picket could
see it. As those were the only posts from
which after seeing it a man could get to Bluffton
in time to give the alarm, the sergeant
and I were more than ever determined to make
our way thither at all hazards. Luckily the
road from Bear&#8217;s Island to Bluffton was the easiest
one in all that country to find, and the one
I happened to know best. So that even if the
sergeant should not get across the marsh, I was
confident of my ability to make the journey
alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the sergeant, &#8220;if I get across I
won&#8217;t wait for you, but will go right on; if you
succeed, don&#8217;t wait for me. It&#8217;s no time for
ceremony. It&#8217;s better one of us should drown
than that the other should be delayed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken like a man and a soldier, sergeant,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;Now for it.&#8221; And with that we again
essayed to follow the submerged track. About
midway the sergeant&#8217;s horse went down as before;
and just as I was about to call out something
encouraging to him the guide&#8217;s horse,
which I was riding, plunged headforemost into
the salt water, throwing me completely over his
head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>For a moment I was senseless from a blow
received either from the hoof of the sergeant&#8217;s
horse, or by falling against one of the timbers
of the causeway. When I came to myself I was
clinging to the tail of the sergeant&#8217;s horse, while
the sergeant, as I presently discovered, was holding
by one of the stirrups.</p>

<p>How long we remained in the water, I do not
know, but it must have been nearly an hour.
The poor horse swam around in a purposeless
way, not knowing where to go, until finally he
sank exhausted beneath the tide. Cool as the
night was the salt water was tepid as it always
is on that coast. Otherwise I should not now
be alive to tell of that Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>We got out at last and found ourselves on
the island again. Despairing now&mdash;for without
horses it was simply impossible to get to
Bluffton until long after the time when our coming
would be of any use&mdash;we trudged doggedly
across the island, that we might wait and listen
at the water&#8217;s edge for the booming of the
cannon.</p>

<p>Two more utterly wretched young men no
Christmas morning ever dawned upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;See there,&#8221; said the sergeant, halting suddenly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s the fleet, and bless my soul
it&#8217;s putting to sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was true enough. No attack was to be
made after all. We had spent the night drowning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
horses, and nearly drowning ourselves for
nothing.</p>

<p>Why the fleet had steamed several miles up
the creek before putting to sea, I have never
been able to guess. But I vividly remember
that its prank subjected me to a twelve miles&#8217;
walk that morning, and compelled me to substitute
quinine and dogwood-root-bark bitters
that day for the Christmas dinner I had
planned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE WOMEN OF PETERSBURG</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WE went into Petersburg in June, 1864,
with the horses at a brisk trot, and the
men on foot at a double quick.</p>

<p>The enemy&#8217;s battalions were already at the
other end of Sycamore Street, and it was our
task to drive them back before they should be
reinforced.</p>

<p>Nevertheless those good women of Petersburg
ministered to us. They knew that we had been
marching all night and that we were in a famishing
condition. They knew also that we must
not waste a moment if Petersburg, the key to
Richmond, was not to be lost.</p>

<p>So they formed themselves in platoons&mdash;God
bless them!&mdash;bearing gifts of sandwiches and
coffee.</p>

<p>We could not stop even to take, much less to
eat, the food they offered, so they thrust their
platoons between ours and marched backward
as fast as we marched forward, serving their
food and drink to us as we went.</p>

<p>Every now and then a Federal shell would
come bowling down the street, but these alert
women would jump it as nimbly as if its passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
had been a prearranged figure in the dance.
Not one of them showed the slightest fear.
Not one of them faltered for a moment in her
ministrations in consideration of herself. There
was not one of them, I think, who would not
have gone with us into the crash of the battle
itself; but by the time we had refreshed ourselves
a little, we were so near to the aggressive
enemy&#8217;s lines, that we cried aloud with one
voice the order for the womenkind to go back.</p>

<p>A minute later we were in the thick of the
struggle for Petersburg. The enemy was not
in such force as we had supposed, and we had
fortunately arrived some hours in advance of
General Grant&#8217;s ponderous divisions. After fifteen
minutes of hard fighting the enemy retired
beyond the Jerusalem turnpike and we spent
the night in beginning that thin line of earthworks
which was destined for eight months to
come to hold at bay a force two or three times
as strong in numbers as our own.</p>

<p>At any hour during all that eight months the
Federal forces could have broken through our
lines at any point they pleased, if they had
been resolute.</p>

<p>Anybody who will look at the old works to-day,
as I have recently done, and consider the
facts dispassionately, can see this clearly for
himself. Our enemies had behind them, and
running parallel with their lines, a system of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
roads that was out of our sight. They had resources
practically illimitable. They had in front
of them an attenuated line of men, stretched
out for twenty miles, and without the possibility
of reinforcement from any source. They could
have concentrated any force they pleased at
any point they pleased and at any time they
pleased, without the possibility of our discovering
what they were doing. They could have
made an irresistible attack upon any point of
our line at will. They did not do it. And so
the fight went on.</p>

<p>During all those weary months the good
women of Petersburg went about their household
affairs with fifteen-inch shells dropping
occasionally into their boudoirs or uncomfortably
near to their kitchen ranges. Yet they
paid no attention to any danger that threatened
themselves.</p>

<p>Their deeds of mercy will never be adequately
recorded until the angels report. But
this much I want to say of them&mdash;they were
&#8220;war women&#8221; of the most daring and devoted
type. When there was need of their ministrations
on the line, they were sure to be promptly
there; and once, as I have recorded elsewhere
in print, a bevy of them came out to the lines
only to encourage us, and, under a fearful fire,
sang Bayard Taylor&#8217;s &#8220;Song of the Camp,&#8221;
giving us as an encore the lines:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Ah, soldiers, to your honored rest,</div>
<div class="verse">Your truth and valor bearing,</div>
<div class="verse">The bravest are the tenderest,</div>
<div class="verse">The loving are the daring.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>With inspiration such as these women gave
us, it was no wonder that, as I heard General
Sherman say soon after the war: &#8220;It took us
four years, with all our enormous superiority in
resources, to overcome the stubborn resistance
of those men.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HAM SEAY</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HAM SEAY had a h&aelig;morrhage that morning&mdash;a
h&aelig;morrhage from the lungs.</p>

<p>But Ham Seay had the fastest horse in the
company, and he knew how to ride a horse for
all that was in him of achievement.</p>

<p>When the news came that Stuart wanted to
communicate as quickly as possible with the
commandant at Fredericksburg, Ham Seay volunteered
to carry the message.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re ill,&#8221; said Stuart.</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said Ham. &#8220;I can
ride my horse, and my horse is a good one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re ill,&#8221; said Stuart again. &#8220;And
I don&#8217;t want to send an ill man on such a
journey as this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ham Seay rose in the majesty of his
manhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;General,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am a doomed man.
I cannot live long to render service in the war.
I want to render what service I can. I want to
carry this message. It will do me no harm.
It will not shorten the few days I have yet to
live. It will make my life worth something.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>So Stuart gave him the message to a general
fifty miles away.</p>

<p>Ham Seay mounted, and said to his comrades:
&#8220;Good-by, boys. I may never see you
again; but I&#8217;ll do this errand all right, or die
trying.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rode his horse with urgency, but with
discretion. He had but one object in view, and
that was to get the message to its destination
in the briefest possible number of hours.</p>

<p>He delivered his communication. He died
half an hour afterwards. His horse had died
before Ham did. But both had done their duty.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OLD JONES&#8217;S DASH</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">OLD Jones was a queer character.
He was also a queer figure. He never
had a uniform. He wore a yellow coat and a
pair of light blue trousers. He wore a pot hat
of the fashion, I should say at a guess, of the
year 1812.</p>

<p>He was a graduate of West Point, but he
had resigned from the army twelve years before
the war began, and therefore was not
entitled to what they called &#8220;relative rank.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was a cynic and a misanthrope. He was
still more pronouncedly a misogynist. He did
not believe in men. He positively disbelieved
in women. He was ready at any time to
affront a man and to treat a woman with conspicuous
contempt. He hated life, and was
ready to give it up at any moment which might
suit the decrees or the aspirations of Fate. He
was ready to fight anything in the world, or anybody,
under any circumstances, or upon any
issue.</p>

<p>That is why he got himself cashiered toward
the end of the war.</p>

<p>But we are dealing with the beginning of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
war. At the beginning of the war he organized
a company of cavalry and got himself
elected its captain. In the regular order of
promotion he soon came to be colonel of the
regiment. It was at this time that the events
recorded in the present story occurred.</p>

<p>When McClellan took command of the Army
of the Potomac, after the stampede at Manassas,
it was under the demoralization of the fearful
panic. It was a part of McClellan&#8217;s program
to send his men out on expeditions of attack in
order to accustom them to the idea of standing
fire. As the end of the summer of 1861 drew
near, he had begun, seriously, to threaten our
position at Centreville.</p>

<p>He would send out men in considerable force
and compel us to meet them with serious intent.
Usually Stuart was able very quickly to discover
the sham character of these advances.
But once in a while they were so well disguised
as to be mistaken for serious attacks.</p>

<p>One day in the autumn the greatest of all
these advances began. The enemy came forward
with every possible appearance of intending
an assault on the Confederate position at
Centreville.</p>

<p>There were cavalry, infantry, and artillery in
the column; and when they reached our picket
lines there was every appearance of serious
conflict in prospect.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>As we sat there on our horses in front of the
line, Stuart came along and said to Colonel
Jones: &#8220;Colonel, I wish you&#8217;d take a dozen
or twenty men, get into the rear of that force,
and find out how much it means.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jones detailed the requisite number of us
from the right of our company, with Captain
Irving in command of them. By riding three
or four miles to the right, we were able to get
in rear of the Federal force. We soon found
that there was no baggage train, no commissary
train, no quartermaster&#8217;s train, and no ammunition
train&mdash;in short, that the advance was not
intended as a serious attack.</p>

<p>By the time that we had found out all this,
we were within fifty yards of the rear of the
Federal lines, and almost immediately opposite
the point where we had left our own command.
We were pretty well hidden by the underbrush
of the woods, as we stood there and looked.</p>

<p>Presently old Jones turned to Charlie Irving
and said: &#8220;The whole thing&#8217;s an egg-shell,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Charlie; &#8220;an egg-shell easily
crushed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jones thought a moment, and then said, with
his nasal drawl: &#8220;I wish I could communicate
with Stuart. I&#8217;d break through that line and
save the trouble of the ride around.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young captain&#8217;s eyes snapped with that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
peculiar sense of humor and that daring which
were his principal characteristics, as he said:
&#8220;Why not break through anyhow, colonel?
Don&#8217;t you think Stuart would understand? I&#8217;ve
never found him slow in getting to windward
of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you say so, captain, I guess we&#8217;ll
do it. It&#8217;ll save the horses, anyhow. Attention,
men!&#8221; with a slow drawl. &#8220;Draw&mdash;sabres!
Forward&mdash;march! Trot&mdash;march! Gallop&mdash;march!
<span class="smcap">Charge!</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>We went through that egg-shell with an enthusiasm
which was <i>not</i> a reflection of the
drawling commands of our colonel.</p>

<p>Captain Irving was right: Stuart was not
slow in getting to windward of things. He
ordered a charge and doubled up that column
like a telescope.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A WOMAN&#8217;S HAIR</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER the battle of Manassas or Bull Run,
fought July 21, 1861, Stuart made his
headquarters in the neighborhood of Fairfax
Court House, with pickets at Falls Church,
Vienna, and other points ten miles or so to the
front.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a strong force, he occupied
Mason&#8217;s and Munson&#8217;s hills, almost under the
guns of the Washington fortifications, and very
much farther in advance than outposts generally
are.</p>

<p>It has since been a puzzle to many military
critics to guess why he did this unusual thing.
Perhaps this story may throw some light on the
problem.</p>

<p>Our company was on picket at Falls Church.
Half a dozen of us kept watch at the edge of
the woods on the top of the hill, while the rest
of the boys took their ease in rear.</p>

<p>It was in that early stage of the war when to
shoot at men seemed to many civilians a species
of sport&mdash;a sort of pursuit of big game.</p>

<p>This Falls Church post was a favorite rendezvous
for this species of sportsmen from Washington.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Our position was an exposed one. Men
not in the army, and even women, liked to ride
out from Washington, crouch behind a pile of
logs, and &#8220;take a crack&#8221; at the rebels.</p>

<p>Now and then they made a widow and some
orphans, and since this was merely a matter of
diversion and entertainment for them, with no
other principle involved, it seemed almost too
bad.</p>

<p>Finally Charlie Irving got &#8220;tired,&#8221; as he put
it, of &#8220;playing partridge for those people to
shoot at.&#8221; Charlie Irving was our captain. He
was a man who never said much, but always
meant a good deal.</p>

<p>The next morning he made the detail for
post duty at the front upon a new principle.
We had been nine days on picket, and it had
been his custom to detail the men for post duty
in front in alphabetical order. This morning
he selected us without reference to our &#8220;turns,&#8221;
and with sole reference to the speed and endurance
of our horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; he said, with that easy familiarity
which made us call him &#8220;Charlie,&#8221; because
we had all gone hunting together as comrades
before the war; &#8220;now, boys, we&#8217;re going to capture
that picket post to-day, and if I find a
civilian among them, I&#8217;m going to hang him to
that chestnut tree for murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>We knew that he would do what he said, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
we were all in hearty sympathy with his purpose.</p>

<p>About ten o&#8217;clock in the morning the sharp-shooting
began. Our captain instantly divided
us into two squads, and without military formalities
said: &#8220;Now, boys, ride to the right and left
and corner &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the only command we received, but
we obeyed it with a will. The two sharp-shooting
citizens who were there that morning escaped
on good horses, but we captured the
pickets.</p>

<p>Among them was a woman&mdash;a Juno in appearance,
with a wealth of raven black hair
twisted carelessly into a loose knot under the
jockey cap she wore.</p>

<p>She was mounted on a superb chestnut mare,
and she knew how to ride.</p>

<p>She might easily have escaped, and at one
time seemed about to do so, but at the critical
moment she seemed to lose her head and so fell
into our hands.</p>

<p>When we brought her to Charlie Irving she
was all smiles and graciousness, and Charlie
was all blushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d hang me to a tree, if I were a man,
I suppose,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And serve me right,
too. As I&#8217;m only a woman, you&#8217;d better send
me to General Stuart, instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>This seemed so obviously the right way out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
of it that Charlie ordered Ham Seay and me to
escort her to Stuart&#8217;s headquarters, which were
under a tree some miles in the rear.</p>

<p>When we got there Stuart seemed to recognize
the young woman. Or perhaps it was only
his habitual and constitutional gallantry that
made him come forward with every manifestation
of welcome, and himself help her off her
horse, taking her by the waist for that purpose.</p>

<p>Ham Seay and I being mere privates were
ordered to another tree. But we could not help
seeing that cordial relations were quickly established
between our commander and this
young woman. We saw her presently take
down her magnificent back hair and remove
from it some papers. They were not &#8220;curl
papers,&#8221; or that sort of stuffing which women
call &#8220;rats.&#8221; Stuart was a very gallant man,
and he received the papers with much fervor.
He spread them out carefully on the ground,
and seemed to be reading what was written or
drawn upon them.</p>

<p>Then he talked long and earnestly with the
young woman and seemed to be coming to
some definite sort of understanding with her.</p>

<p>Then she dined with him on some fried salt
pork and some hopelessly indigestible fried
paste which we called bread.</p>

<p>Then he mounted her on her mare again
and summoned Ham Seay and me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>&#8220;Escort this young lady back to Captain
Irving,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Tell him to send her to the
Federal lines under flag of truce, with the message
that she was inadvertently captured in a
picket charge, and that as General Stuart does
not make war on women or children, he begs to
return her to her home and friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did all this.</p>

<p>The next day, Stuart with a strong force
advanced to Mason&#8217;s and Munson&#8217;s hills.</p>

<p>From there we could clearly see a certain
house in Washington. It had many windows,
and each had a dark Holland shade.</p>

<p>When we stood guard we were ordered to
observe minutely and report accurately the
slidings up and down of those Holland shades.</p>

<p>We never knew what three shades up, two
half up, and five down might signify. But we
had to report it, nevertheless, and Stuart seemed
from that time to have an almost preternatural
advance perception of the enemy&#8217;s movements.</p>

<p>That young woman certainly had a superb
shock of hair.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A MIDNIGHT CRIME<br />


<small>THE CRIMINAL&#8217;S OWN ACCOUNT OF IT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS there is no law that can now reach my
crime, I may as well tell all about it.</p>

<p>Soon after we sat down before Petersburg, in
the summer of 1864, I was sent on a little military
mission accompanied by Johnny Garrett,
into the land of desolation&mdash;that part of
Northern Virginia which lay sometimes in the
possession of one army, sometimes in possession
of the other, but was mostly left in nobody&#8217;s possession
at all, and open to raids from both sides.</p>

<p>That region had been swept by fire and sword
for nearly four years. It had been tramped over
by both armies, and latterly had been subjected
to that process of destruction which Sheridan
had in mind when he said of another region
that &#8220;the crow that flies over it must carry his
rations with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>How anybody managed to live at all in such
a region has always been a puzzle, but a few
people did.</p>

<p>We had slept, Johnny Garrett and I, by the
side of a fence the night before, and without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
breakfast we had been riding all day. Late in
the afternoon we made up our minds to go for
supper and lodging to a great country house
which I had frequently visited as a guest in the
days of its abundance. As we rode through the
plantation, decay manifested itself on every
hand. There was a small, straggling crop in
process of growth, but sadly ill attended.
There were no animals in sight except five
sheep that we saw grazing on a hillside.</p>

<p>As we turned the corner of the woodland the
mansion came into view. Only its walls were
left standing. Fire had destroyed the rest. At
the gate we met an old negro serving-man,
whom I had known in the palmy days as
Uncle Isham.</p>

<p>When I had seen him last he was in livery.
As I saw him <i>now</i> he was in rags.</p>

<p>Some eager, hurried inquiries as to the family
brought out the fact that the mistress of
the mansion with her two grown daughters was
living in one of the negro quarters in rear of the
burned house, and that he, alone, remained as a
servant on the plantation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey took all de res&#8217; off No&#8217;th, an&#8217; dey tried
to take Isham, too. But Isham he slip&#8217; de
bridle one night, an&#8217; he came back heah to
look after ole missus an&#8217; de girls. So heah I is,
an&#8217; heah Ise gwine to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did not remain to hear Isham&#8217;s account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
of his adventures, but hurried on to find out the
condition of things with the family. There
were but two rooms&mdash;one below, and the other
above stairs&mdash;in the hut in which they were
living. Yet the proud woman who was thus
reduced showed no shame of her poverty, but
gloried in it rather, as the old soldier glories in
the scars received in his country&#8217;s service.</p>

<p>She welcomed us with as warm a show of
hospitality as she had ever made in the old
days of lavish entertainment.</p>

<p>After our first inquiries concerning their welfare,
she said to us laughingly: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
keep you to-night, but would send you on
to a better place, if I knew any better in
the neighborhood. As it is, you&#8217;ll have to
sleep under the trees for lack of room; but
you boys are rather used to that. As for
supper, I can give you some corn-bread and
some sorghum molasses. The bread won&#8217;t be
very good, because our supply of salt has run
out, and of course as the cows have all been
killed I can&#8217;t give you butter. But there&#8217;s
enough bread and sorghum, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long since you had meat?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;About three weeks,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;That is
to say, since the last big raiding party came
by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you no pigs left?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we haven&#8217;t a living animal of any kind.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;Whose sheep are those I saw as I rode up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They belong to a neighbor,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;They&#8217;re what&#8217;s left of a large flock. When
the raiders were here those five sheep ran into
the bushes and escaped. But even if they were
ours, you know, we couldn&#8217;t kill one.&#8221;</p>

<p>I remembered then that a law of the Confederacy
made it a crime severely punishable to
slaughter a sheep, even one&#8217;s own. They were
wanted by the government for their wool to
clothe the army.</p>

<p>Waiving all this aside as a matter of small
moment, our hostess pressed us again to dismount
for supper.</p>

<p>At this point Johnny Garrett lied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we can&#8217;t stay to supper, and the fact is
we couldn&#8217;t eat if we did. It&#8217;s only half an hour
since we ate the best part of a ham out of our
haversacks. And besides we&#8217;ve got to get to
Gordonsville to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am afraid I was accessory after the fact to
the telling of that lie. At least I didn&#8217;t contradict
it.</p>

<p>We pushed on a little way till we had got
out of sight of the house. Then we stopped by
mutual consent under a tree and dismounted.</p>

<p>&#8220;The grass is pretty good,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll
let the horses crop it while we wait for it to get
good and dark.&#8221; It did not seem necessary to
mention what we were to wait for darkness for.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Johnny, &#8220;there are the sheep,
and I&#8217;ll keep an eye on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>When it was thoroughly dark we committed
a double crime.</p>

<p>It was sheep stealing as well as a violation of
the other law, but we were not in a mood to
consider such things just then. Under cover
of the darkness we killed the fattest sheep in
the lot, dressed it as well as we could, and then
by the light of some matches I wrote a little
note on a leaf from my memorandum book. It
said simply this:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no law to forbid some hungry
women to eat a sheep that somebody else has
killed in violation of law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pinning this to the carcass we carried the
mutton to the house, and hung it to a tree
where it would be seen with the dawn.</p>

<p>We felt as well about this thing as if we had
been engaged in some highly moral act.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A LITTLE REBEL</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was an odd kind of a situation. It was in
1862, and we were on the coast of South
Carolina defending the railroad line between
Charleston and Savannah.</p>

<p>We had no infantry supports, and artillery is
supposed to be helpless without such supports.
But as there was nothing on the other side, except
those pestilent sharp-shooters in the Hayward
mansion, we did not need support.</p>

<p>It was our business to shell that mansion,
burn it, and drive the sharp-shooters out. I
may say, parenthetically, that we didn&#8217;t like the
business. Mr. Hayward, who was familiarly
known as &#8220;Tiger Bill,&#8221; had been the friend of
our battery ever since we had succeeded in putting
out a fire that had burnt some thousands
of panels of fence for him. It is true that his
friendship for us was in the main a reflex of his
enmity to the Charleston Light Dragoons and
the Routledge Mounted Riflemen. He favored
us mainly to spite them. Nevertheless he
favored us. He sent a wagon every morning
to our camp loaded with vegetables, fruits, suckling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
pigs, and whatever else his dozen plantations
might afford.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p090.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">She was singing &#8220;Dixie.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Naturally, we did not like the job of burning
one of his country houses. But as business is
business, so in war orders are orders.</p>

<p>Half a dozen shells did the work. Flames
burst from the house in every direction, and
the enemy&#8217;s sharp-shooters who had been using
it as a vantage ground rapidly retreated across
the cotton fields to the woodlands beyond under
fire of our guns.</p>

<p>Our captain, a great bearded warrior, six feet
four inches high, and as rough as men are made
in appearance, was suddenly seized with a tender
thought. Turning to me, he said: &#8220;There
may be some poor devil wounded in that house
and likely to be roasted. Let&#8217;s ride over there
and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>We put spurs to our horses, dashed through
the sharp-shooters&#8217; fire, and a few minutes later
began exploring the lower quarters of the house,
the fire being above. We found nothing till we
came to the cellar. There we discovered a little
girl, anywhere from two to three years old,&mdash;I&#8217;m
not a good judge of little girls&#8217; ages,&mdash;sitting
in a little rocking-chair, and singing &#8220;Dixie.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain grabbed her suddenly and ran to
the open air with her, for the volumes of smoke
were rapidly penetrating to the cellar. When
he got her out, he said: &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>She replied, in a piping little voice, &#8220;I&#8217;m
<i>Lulalie</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether this meant that her name was Lula
Lee, or Eulalie, or what, we could not make out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your mamma?&#8221; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s dead&mdash;she died when I was born.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your papa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Those ugly other people
took him away. When he saw &#8217;em coming, he
took me to the cellar, and told me to stay there
so the shellies wouldn&#8217;t hit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your maumey?&#8221; (Maumey meaning
in South Carolina &#8220;negro nurse.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Those ugly
other people took all the colored folks away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the battery advanced with its colors
flying. Looking up the little girl recognized
the Confederate battle banner and said: &#8220;That&#8217;s
<i>my kind of a flag</i>. I don&#8217;t like that ugly other
striped thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Manifestly the child was without protectors.
We adopted her in the name of the battery.</p>

<p>When we returned to the camp several serious
questions arose. Jack Hawkins, one of the ex-circus
clowns of the battery, suggested that first
of all we must secure a chaperone for her.
When asked what he meant by that, he said
with lordly superiority: &#8220;Well, you see, chaperone
is French for nurse. We want a nurse
for this little child.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Denton, the other ex-circus
clown, &#8220;you don&#8217;t know any more about the
proprieties than you do about French. Chaperone
means somebody to look after a church,
and this little girl isn&#8217;t even a chapel. We&#8217;ll
look after her, and we don&#8217;t want no nurse to
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain, with his long beard, was holding
the little child in his arms all this time, and she
suddenly turned around to him and seizing his
beard said: &#8220;I like your big whiskers. They
are like my papa&#8217;s. You don&#8217;t bite, because
you&#8217;ve got hair on your face?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t bite such as
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he was very much given to biting, all the
same&mdash;as the enemy had more than once
found out.</p>

<p>&#8220;First of all,&#8221; said Denton, who was nothing
if not practical, &#8220;the little girl&#8217;s got to have
some clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denton was a tailor, as well as a clown, and
naturally his thoughts were the first to run in
that groove.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t much used to making girl&#8217;s clothes,
but a tailor&#8217;s a tailor, and if anybody&#8217;ll provide
me the materials, I&#8217;ll undertake to fix up some
gowns for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Booker, who was much given to riding
around the country, said at once: &#8220;I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
where the mortal remains of an old store repose,
up at Gillisonville, about nine miles away.
If I had any money&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Every man thrust his hand into his pocket,
and each drew out what he had. The sum total
was more than adequate. When Tom returned
a few hours later there were no &#8220;mortal remains&#8221;
of that store left. He brought back with him
thirty-seven yards of highly colored calico, of
different patterns, one red blanket, a box full
of galloon trimming, something that he called
&#8220;gimp,&#8221; two bolts of domestic, three cans of
tomatoes, and two bottles of chow-chow, besides
a dozen quarter cases of sardines and two kegs
of cove oysters.</p>

<p>He dumped the merchandise on the ground
with the remark: &#8220;There, I&#8217;ve closed that store.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denton made some invidious remarks reflecting
upon Tom&#8217;s taste in the selection of calicoes,
etc., adding the suggestion that there was galloon
enough and &#8220;gimp&#8221; enough in the invoice
&#8220;to upholster all the women in Charleston for
the next six months&mdash;if they liked that kind
of thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he set to work with a will.
Within a day or two the little lady was provided
with gowns and night-gowns, and underclothes
sufficient in quantity, at least, though perhaps
not made strictly in accordance with the latest
fashions in gear of that kind. Indeed, Denton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
had succeeded in making her look very much
hindsidebefore. The little girl&#8217;s gowns all buttoned
down in front. But the little girl was
pleased with what she called the &#8220;gownies&#8221;
and sometimes the &#8220;pritties.&#8221; Their barbaric
colors tickled her taste so much that Denton
decided to make her a cloak out of the flaming
red blanket.</p>

<p>When it was put on her, her glory was complete.
She said: &#8220;It looks like my kind of a
flag,&#8221; referring to the red of the battle banner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She was taken away from us presently by a
committee of good women of the neighborhood.
She became the prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of a lady whose whole
life had been given to caring for other people,
including our battery.</p>

<p>Denton, however, put in a claim to the privilege
of continuing to fashion her clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see I&#8217;ve got the whole stock of that
store on my hands; and since I learned dress-making,
I&#8217;ve a fancy to perfect myself. And
you see I&#8217;ve got fond of the little girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>A couple of tears trickled down the hoary
old sinner&#8217;s cheek, and Mrs. Hutson consented.</p>

<p>Every day after roll-call the captain sent a
delegation to the Hutsons&#8217; house to ask after
the battery&#8217;s child. Every day when we drilled
at the guns the little girl herself came in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
barbaric costume to see what she called her
&#8220;shooties,&#8221; meaning the cannoneers.</p>

<p>We had to part with our little girl presently,
we being under orders, and she stationed. As
we moved away from the station on our flat
cars, she stood upon the platform, and waved
&#8220;her kind of a flag&#8221; at us, crying, throwing
kisses, and calling out: &#8220;Good-by, you good
shooties.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think the morals of the battery were distinctly
better after this little episode.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TWENTY-ONE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER the battle of Bull Run, or Manassas,
as we called it, the region north of Fairfax
Court House was a No-man&#8217;s land.</p>

<p>Little by little we occupied it during that
summer, even to Mason&#8217;s and Munson&#8217;s hills.
But the process of occupation was slow. When
we pressed forward immediately after the battle
all that region was <i>terra incognita</i>.</p>

<p>About half the people inhabiting it were loyal
to one side; about half to the other. So in
asking information we had to be circumspect.</p>

<p>But we had assurance that the Hopes were
loyal to our side. So when Lieutenant Billy
Wilds was sent out with a party of us, on scouting
duty, he naturally went to the Hope mansion
for information.</p>

<p>He got it in abundance. Charlotte Hope, the
daughter of the house, came out to give it to us,
and she was very enthusiastic. She was a brunette,
full of life, full of health, and full of enthusiasm
for the cause. Besides, she knew how
to sit gracefully on a rail fence. She had a rich
contralto voice that had narrowly escaped being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
a bass. She was beautiful to her finger tips.
She &#8220;had a way with her&#8221; that was fascinating
beyond belief.</p>

<p>As she sat there on the rail fence, explaining
the geography of the region round about, we all
fell in love with her as troopers should, so far at
least as to be ready to do any conceivable deed
of derring-do in her behalf. But Lieutenant
Wilds fell in love with her in fuller fashion, as
was afterwards made manifest.</p>

<p>She sat there on the fence curled up most
entrancingly and expounded the geography of
the country with great minuteness. But when
she tried to tell us just where a certain strong
Federal post was, which we very much wanted
to attack, she grew impatient of words.</p>

<p>Turning to a negro boy she said: &#8220;Saddle
Saladin. I&#8217;ll go and show them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three minutes later she was in the saddle.
Half an hour afterwards Charlie Irving, our
captain who had joined us and taken command,
gently ordered her to the rear. As I have
related in another book of reminiscences she
refused to obey. She said: &#8220;I believe you are
going to charge those fellows, and I want to see
the fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, she saw the fun. We made the charge.
At the end of it Lieutenant Wilds was more in
love with her than ever.</p>

<p>As we escorted her back to her home she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
broke into song. Her song was the old English
ballad which begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;In days of old, when knights were bold,</div>
<div class="verse">And barons held their sway.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>As she sang, she laid special stress upon two
passages in the ballad. One was the line where
the hero says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;I&#8217;ll live for love or die.&#8221;</div>

<p>The other was, where as death overcomes him
he sings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;I&#8217;ve kept the vow I swore.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The song seemed, whether prophetically or
otherwise, to have entered this young girl&#8217;s soul
and to have taken possession of her spirit.</p>

<p>It was not long afterwards that we learned
that our gallant young lieutenant was engaged
to be married to Charlotte Hope. The marriage
was to take place as soon as the war was over.
At that time we regarded this as a postponement
of only a few months at most. We expected to
win then and we expected to win quickly.</p>

<p>Whenever Lieutenant Wilds was sent upon
a scouting expedition, he found it imperatively
necessary to call at the Hope mansion for geographical
and other information, though by this
time we had all become familiar with every road
and footpath in that quarter of Virginia.</p>

<p>It was a little fiction we were all pleased to love
him for. One day about a month later, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
we were waiting in the yard for Lieutenant
Wilds to secure the necessary geographical information
indoors, a Federal force attacked us.
The lieutenant came out promptly, swung himself
into the saddle, and ordered a charge. We
fought there under the cherry trees for full
fifteen minutes. At the end of the contest the
enemy was driven away, and we pursued&mdash;but
three of our saddles were empty.</p>

<p>One of them was that of Lieutenant Wilds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was Charlotte&#8217;s wish that Lieutenant Wilds
should be buried in the family grave-yard of the
Hopes. It was also her wish that his company
should attend the funeral.</p>

<p>We brought two other companies along to
stand guard and prevent any possible interruption
of the ceremonies. We buried our comrade
with all military honors. We fired the
conventional salute over the grave.</p>

<p>Then we proceeded to attack a military force
which had come up, intent upon disturbing the
obsequies.</p>

<p>But before we moved off, Charlotte, who had
been dry-eyed from the first, came to one of us
and said: &#8220;He was just twenty-one. It will
take just twenty-one to pay for him.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was only two or three days later when
Charlie Hopper rode into the camp on a magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
chestnut-sorrel mare. We did not know
him.</p>

<p>He said he didn&#8217;t want to enlist. He merely
wanted to join the company. He explained
that if he enlisted he would be a man under pay.
And he didn&#8217;t want pay, he said, for the work
he wanted to do. Only give him rations and a
chance and he would be satisfied.</p>

<p>His idea of a chance soon developed itself.
He wanted to be as continually as possible in
the presence of the enemy, anywhere, anyhow.
He wanted to shoot all the &#8220;Yankees&#8221; he could.
For that purpose he had brought with him the
first Whitworth rifle I ever saw, with its long
range, its telescopic sights, and its terrible accuracy
of fire.</p>

<p>He seemed about sixteen years old. He
didn&#8217;t tell us anything about himself, not even
where he came from. But he had a long talk,
and a confidential one, with Charlie Irving.
After that Charlie paid him special attention.
He detailed him upon every scouting expedition
that had &#8220;business&#8221; in it. Sometimes when
scouting expeditions were slack, the young fellow
would go off by himself and remain for a
day or two in close proximity to the enemy&#8217;s
lines.</p>

<p>Each day he wore upon his breast a little tag
with a number on it.</p>

<p>One day when the number had reached seventeen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
he and I lay together behind a sycamore
log, shooting at a peculiarly pestilent picket
post. After one of his shots he called out,
&#8220;Eighteen.&#8221; The next shot was simultaneous,
he and I firing together. The man at whom we
fired fell forward over his log, evidently dead.</p>

<p>Charlie Hopper turned to me and said: &#8220;You
fired at the same moment I did; it&#8217;s a disputed
bird. I can&#8217;t count him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Full of curiosity I asked: &#8220;What do you
mean, Hopper?&#8221;</p>

<p>He answered: &#8220;Nothing&mdash;Just counting&mdash;Settling
a score!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was only a few days later when we were
at Falls Church. Young Hopper&#8217;s score read
twenty, when he asked permission to ride out
and personally encounter an officer who had
separated himself from his command. The permission
was given. Hopper leaped upon his
mare, drew his sword, and galloped toward the
officer. They met in mid field. The officer
fired just as the boy clove him to the saddle.
Hopper fell forward on his horse and rode
back to the lines.</p>

<p>As he rolled off the saddle, he said: &#8220;I&#8217;m
done for, boys, but I&#8217;ve made it twenty-one without
counting a single disputed bird.&#8221; Then,
feebly, he broke into song, singing,&mdash;</p>

<p>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve kept the vow I swore.&#8221;<br />
</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>Before we buried him in the <i>Hope cemetery</i>
the next day, the captain told me that Charlie
Hopper was none other than Charlotte Hope.</p>

<p>But I had guessed the secret that day when
she had refused to count the &#8220;disputed bird.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A BEEF EPISODE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WE had no rations at Bluffton, in South
Carolina.</p>

<p>The sea was there with its multitudinous fish,
and crabs and shrimps, and with its mountainous
banks of oysters. There were turkeys and deer
and squirrels in the woods, and quail and marsh
fowl in the fields. We were expected to take
care of ourselves.</p>

<p>But one cannot shoot turkeys, or deer, or
squirrels with a twelve-pounder Napoleon. And
as for the sea food, while we rejoiced in it
for a time, we became desperately weary of it
after a while.</p>

<p>We began, therefore, to frequent Bull Island.
Bull Island lay near Hilton Head, which the
enemy occupied. Bull Island had been abandoned
at the beginning of the war, and the
cattle on the plantations there had gone wild,
breeding as buffalo might.</p>

<p>Here was a source of supply. We resolved
to avail ourselves of it. About twice a week we
sent expeditions over there in whale-boats, and
killed a bullock or a cow or two, dressed the
meat and brought it home, taking care to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
the skin also, in order that our half-crazy doctor
might experiment on it with his new process
for quick tanning. As an incident, I may remark
that not one of us ever got a pair of boots
out of those hides.</p>

<p>The enemy on Hilton Head were also more
or less in lack of beef. They, too, discovered
Bull Island, and frequented it with a purpose
similar to our own.</p>

<p>One day Joe went over there with sixteen
men in a boat carrying that number of oars,
and pretty well rigged for sailing. He had no
sooner got his command into the cane-brake in
search of cattle, than he discovered a party of
Federals immediately in front of him. In the
dense growth of the forest he could have no
idea whatever of his enemy&#8217;s strength. His
one thought was, to avoid the capture of his
force. To that end he must make as brave a
show of strength as possible. He therefore
ordered his little squad of men to scatter themselves
out over a line of three or four hundred
yards, and to keep up as continuous a fire as
possible.</p>

<p>The enemy&#8217;s line seemed to be of about equal
length, and their fire about the same as his. It
was a little before ten o&#8217;clock in the morning
when this thing began, and it was not until
after dusk that the two forces sneaked simultaneously
to their boats.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Neither had any beef, and each discovered
that the other was numerically about equal to
itself.</p>

<p>So far as we were ever able to discover, nobody
had been killed or wounded on either side.
A day had been wasted in futile firing through
the cane. Both sides had been disappointed of
their provisions.</p>

<p>Neither had injured the other, neither had
gained any benefit, and the cattle had had a
good time.</p>

<p>Thirty years afterwards Joe and the sergeant
on the other side met, and one said to the other:
&#8220;After all it would have been better if we had
turned our backs on each other that day. There
were cattle on both sides.&#8221; The other answered:
&#8220;Yes, but that would have been the wise way
of peace; we were engaged in the barbarism of
war.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BERNARD POLAND&#8217;S PROPHECY</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;DO not pretend to understand it at all.</p>

<p>The best theories I have ever been able
to form, whether physiological or psychological,
or a mixture of the two, have utterly failed to
account to my mind for the facts in Bernard
Poland&#8217;s case.</p>

<p>I tell the story, therefore, without trying to
explain it.</p>

<p>In the year 1857 I became a student in a
Virginian college not far from Richmond. When
I took possession of my quarters in the building
three or four days before the session began, I
was an entire stranger to every one there. As
I had already spent two years in another college,
I knew the importance of using circumspection
in the choice of friends in such a place, so that
I was in no hurry to make acquaintances. It
was my deliberate purpose, indeed, to avoid all
intercourse with my fellow-students, until such
time as I should discover who and what they
were.</p>

<p>But one morning&mdash;the next after my arrival,
I think it was&mdash;as I sat in the great stone
portico, two students, evidently old acquaintances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and both of them members of the college
during the previous year, stood near me discussing
some matter or other, I forget what.</p>

<p>The younger was bantering and teasing the
other by expressing all sorts of unconventional,
radical, and even revolutionary opinions, which
his friend took the trouble seriously to combat,
greatly to the younger man&#8217;s amusement, as I
could see. Their conversation did not impress
me in the least, except as it revealed to me
something in the younger man&#8217;s mind and character
which fascinated me unaccountably.</p>

<p>His age was about the same as mine. His
scholarship was about equally advanced, as I
learned when we entered the same class. Like
myself he had been an omnivorous reader; but
where I had read with a disposition to select
and criticise and differ, he appeared to have
read with the most hospitable mind I ever knew.
He gave at least a <i>quasi</i>-belief to everything
that literature had to offer for his entertainment.
He was very slender, even to frailty of body.
He had a thin and not handsome face, rather
sharp features, lips on which there was a singularly
joyous smile, and great gray eyes filled
with an extraordinary sadness. The mouth and
eyes contradicted each other so flatly, that during
all the years of our acquaintance I was
never quite able to persuade myself that they
properly belonged to the same countenance;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
that one or the other portion of the face was not
always hiding behind a mask. The effect was
indescribable; and among all the men and
women I have ever known I have seen nothing
else like it.</p>

<p>I knew nothing about the man except as I
had caught from conversation that his name
was Bernard Poland. Yet the moment I saw
him, and listened to his chatter, I made up my
mind that he should be my closest friend. I
felt that between him and me there would grow
up that intellectual sympathy which is the only
secure basis of friendship between men.</p>

<p>Not that he and I were at all alike in any way.
Indeed, two more utterly unlike personalities it
would be difficult to find or imagine. I was
serious; he playful, always. I was robust and
inclined to plume myself somewhat upon my
muscularity; while he was delicate both in frame
and health, and cared next to nothing for any
of the rougher sports in which I took almost an
insane delight. Intellectually, too, we were exact
opposites, as I have already hinted. I was
inclined to doubt and to question all things,
rejecting all that I failed to comprehend and
account for; he was something of a mystic&mdash;not
superstitious, but abounding in faith, and
still more in the possibilities of faith.</p>

<p>He was never quite ready, dogmatically, to
reject anything, however incapable of proof it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
might be, so long as it was also incapable of
positive and conclusive refutation.</p>

<p>He was not credulous exactly, yet he scouted
no superstition which was not either manifestly
or demonstrably absurd.</p>

<p>All this I learned afterwards, however. At
present I was not even acquainted with him,
though I had made up my mind to introduce
myself after the free and easy manner that
obtains among schoolmates.</p>

<p>When he had finished his bantering talk with
his fellow-student, he walked away to his room,
which was in sight as I sat there in the portico.
The other student strolled down the roadway
leading to the great gates. He had no sooner
gone than Bernard Poland came out again, and
walking up to me said: &#8220;You and I ought to
be friends, and will be, I think. My name is
Bernard Poland. What&#8217;s yours? This is a singular
way to introduce oneself, but I can&#8217;t help
it. The moment I saw you sitting there I made
up my mind that you and I would be chums.
What do you say, old fellow?&#8221;</p>

<p>To say that I was astonished is to express my
feelings feebly. I was startled, almost frightened,
at his words, which were identically those
that I had been revolving in my mind as a possible
or impossible introductory address to him.</p>

<p>We were friends at once. And though I
have known many other friendships, I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
known none closer or more satisfactory than
that then formed with Bernard Poland. We
became, as he said, &#8220;Chums.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the long vacation Bernard spent
many weeks with me at my home, and I in
turn visited him in a delightful old Virginian
house, where father, mother, brother, and sister
held him in tenderest regard as their chief
object of affection.</p>

<p>After our college days were done we missed
no opportunity of spending a day or a week
together, our affection suffering no diminution
and knowing no change.</p>

<p>One day in 1859, or about that time, we were
riding together over a beautiful region in Northern
Virginia. We talked of a hundred things,
as was our custom. Among them a number of
metaphysical and psychological things came up
for discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said Bernard presently, &#8220;I
sometimes think prophecy isn&#8217;t so strange a
thing after all as most people think it. I
really see no reason why any earnest man might
not be able to foresee the future now and then
in moments of exaltation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s reason enough to my mind,&#8221; I replied,
&#8220;in the fact that future events do not
exist as yet. We cannot know that which is
not, though we may shrewdly guess it at
times. But when we do, we are only arguing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
from known or suspected causes to their necessary
consequences. And that is in no proper
sense prophecy at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your argument is good enough, but the
premises are bad, I think,&#8221; replied my friend,
meditatively, his mouth wreathed with a smile,
but his great sad eyes looking solemnly into
mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! I doubt the truth of your assumption
that future events do not exist as yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go on; I&#8217;m ready to hear your explanation
or your theory or whatever else it
is,&#8221; said I, laughingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know that the idea is mine at
all. I suppose that others have gone over the
ground before me, though I think, perhaps, my
application of the thought is new. What I
have in mind is this: Past and Future are only
divisions of <span class="smcap">Time</span>. They do not belong at all
to Eternity. We, living in Time, cannot divest
ourselves of its trammels. We cannot conceive
of any event without assigning a Time relation
to it; without investing it with the trammels
and harness and paraphernalia of Time. To
us every event must be Past, or Future, with
reference to other events. But is there, in
reality, any such thing as a Past or a Future?
If there is any such thing as Eternity, it now
is and always has been and ever must be.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
Time is a mere delusion: a false medium,
through which we look at things askant. As
there can be no such thing as Time in Eternity,
there can be no such thing there as a Past or a
Future event. If Eternity is anything more
than Time exaggerated and extended,&mdash;if, indeed,
there is any such thing as Eternity,&mdash;it is
not subject to the laws and conditions of Time.
There can be no Past and no Future there; but
only an Eternal NOW.</p>

<p>&#8220;The absolute truth is not that which we see
through a distorting medium of Time, but that
which we should see if we were in Eternity and
freed from the illusions of Time. To beings
who see thus clearly and truthfully, all things
must exist in an eternal Present. All things
that have been or shall be, <i>now are</i>. What we
call &#8216;Memory,&#8217; is only a mode of consciousness,
and to know a Future event is a precisely similar
mode of consciousness. Memory and prevision
are only different ways of knowing a fact that
now is. I see no reason to regard the one as
any more truly impossible than the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I grant that in its ordinary Time-clogged
state the mind is not capable of discovering
those occurrences which to us seem future ones.
But it seems to me that there are, or at least
may be, conditions of mind in which one rises
above the trammels of Time and sees things
as they are. Every true poet is at times a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
prophet by reason of this exaltation of soul.
And all the well-attested prophets are poets
of the first order.&#8221;</p>

<p>My friend had no opportunity to finish, nor I
to reply to his wire-drawn metaphysics, as we
were joined at this stage of the conversation by
an acquaintance of the earth earthy, whose talk
was of crops.</p>

<p>When he quitted us we were nearing a line
of hills to which Bernard directed my attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;That would make
a magnificent battlefield.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew his enthusiastic fondness for the study
of military history and the details of battles. In
common with most other people who have seen
nothing of war, I had never been able to picture
a battle in my mind; and in reading history I
had always found it difficult to comprehend the
topographical descriptions of battlefields, or to
understand the influence of hill and dale, of
copse and stream, upon the issue of a combat.
Bernard had mastered the whole subject. He
had often moulded in soft earth for my instruction
miniature, but exact, representations of
many famous battlefields.</p>

<p>The ground we were on was a chain of hills
crossing a public thoroughfare, and my friend
soon grew enthusiastic in his account of how
one army would be posted here, and the other
there; how the flanks of each would rest upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
certain protected points and how the attacking
force would try to carry this or that position.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the attacking general knows his business,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;he will strain every nerve to drive his
adversary from that little knoll there. And if
he succeeds in planting a battery or two there,
properly supported, his enemy will have to
charge him out of the place or reconstruct his
own lines, and to reconstruct them will cost him
half the value of his position.&#8221;</p>

<p>A new look came into Bernard&#8217;s face. The
smile had gone from his lips, the great sad look
was in his eyes. Gazing at me with intense
earnestness, he cried out: &#8220;He <i>must</i> drive them
back. If they once hold that knoll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Bernard paused, grew very pale, and then
said with some difficulty with his vocal organs:
&#8220;Let&#8217;s gallop away from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I followed his retreating form, and when we
drew rein again, we were a full mile distant from
the place of this field lecture. My friend had
meantime regained his color and composure, but
the old smile had not yet returned to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ill, Bernard?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am quite well, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you all about it if you won&#8217;t laugh
at me,&#8221; he said, his lips resuming something of
their ordinary expression. &#8220;The fact is, all that
was prophecy, or prevision, or what you please<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
to call it. While I was explaining an imaginary
and possible battle, it became real. <span class="smcap">That
battle is a fact.</span> I saw the two armies as
plainly as I see you, and when the enemy
planted that battery there on the hill, driving
our forces away, I was among the troops
ordered to charge them as a forlorn hope, and
<i>I fell right there, in front of the guns, riddled
with canister shot</i>. I was ahead of the line,
for some reason, and just as I fell our men
were driven back by a counter-charge right
over my body. My friend, prevision is possible.
Prevision is a fact. The battle, the
charge, the counter-charge, and my death, right
there, are what we call Future events. But I
know them now as well as I know anything
else. I saw it all. I know it for truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was horrified. I tried to draw his mind
away from the distressing picture he had conjured
up. He seeing my purpose said: &#8220;I am
not demented, and this doesn&#8217;t trouble me in
the least. It is all fact, but I am not unhappy
about it. I turned pale, it is true&mdash;any
man would with half a dozen canister shot
passing through his body. But I am not
frightened, not demoralized, and not in the
least apprehensive. I don&#8217;t know when all
this is to happen, and as our country is at peace
with all the world, I think it is not likely that
the battle will come soon. <span class="smcap">But it will come.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span></span>
Be sure of that. Now let&#8217;s talk of something
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he resolutely dismissed the subject,
and he never referred to it again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the terrible campaign of 1864, the
command to which I belonged, after a hard
day&#8217;s march, was sent at ten o&#8217;clock at night to
take post upon the line.</p>

<p>All night long we lay there expecting the
furious onset of the enemy, whose plan it
seemed to be to keep us perpetually marching
or fighting.</p>

<p>With the early dawn came the battle. And
as daylight revealed the features of the newly
chosen battlefield, I recognized it as precisely
the one that Bernard and I had ridden over
several years before. On my right, less than
half a mile away, a furious struggle was in
progress. I looked and saw our troops driven
back from the little eminence on which he and
I had stood. The enemy hurried two batteries
forward, and planting them there opened a
fierce, enfilading fire upon that part of the line
in which I stood.</p>

<p>I saw at once that if those batteries should
remain there, we must retire and reconstruct our
lines. We stood our ground, however, in the
hope that the critical position might be recovered.
Quickly an attempt was made to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
end. A heavy body of infantry was thrown
forward with desperate impulse, and straining
my eyes with an intensity of eagerness, which I
had never felt before, I saw one slender form in
advance of the line. A dense volume of powder
smoke immediately shut out the view.</p>

<p>When it cleared away the enemy&#8217;s batteries
were still there. Our men had been repulsed.
A minute later a second charge was made and
it proved successful.</p>

<p>But I knew that I had lost a friend there.</p>

<p>The battle over, I scanned every list of killed
and wounded I could find, but could learn
nothing of my friend from them. I had every
reason to believe that he was not there at all.
He had been taken prisoner some months
before and paroled. When I had last heard
from him he was quietly pursuing his studies at
home while waiting for his exchange.</p>

<p>I tried to console myself with this and with
the reflection that the partial fulfilment of his
prophecy was quite accidental and constituted
no reason for assuming its complete fulfilment.</p>

<p>We were on the march or in action all the
time, too; and I had plenty of occupation with
which to drive depressing thoughts from my
mind.</p>




<p>We finally sat down before Petersburg, and
the eternity of an eight months&#8217; siege began. I
was sent to Richmond on some military errand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
and while there availed myself of the opportunity
to visit some friends.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p118.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The last that was seen of Bernard Poland.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Bernard?&#8221; I asked as lightly as I
could, of one who was intimate with his family.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard?&#8221; he replied. &#8220;The
poor fellow was exchanged in the spring, was
elected first lieutenant of a company, and was
killed, it is supposed, in one of the battles, I
forget which. He was in command of his company,
when it was ordered to charge some field
batteries on a little hill, and his men say he was
last seen ten or a dozen feet in advance of the
line, just before a counter-charge drove them
back. As the counter-charge was preceded
immediately by a volley of canister, the smoke
hid him from view. But there seems to be no
doubt that he fell there, riddled with canister
shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few days later I received a letter from one
of Bernard&#8217;s brother officers, in which, after
recapitulating the facts already set forth, he
went on to say: &#8220;Before we were ordered to the
charge, Bernard specially requested me, in the
event of his death that day, to write you an exact
description of the spot on which he fell. He said,
&#8216;He will remember it.&#8217; Though what he meant
by that, I have never been able to guess. But
in loyalty to the love I bore him, I have taken
this first opportunity to comply with the last
request he made on earth.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>The author of that letter who now occupies a
prominent position in public life will understand,
after reading this sketch, what Bernard meant
in saying that I would remember the spot on
which he fell.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A BREACH OF ETIQUETTE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WE had marched nearly all night, in order
to join Jeb Stuart at the time appointed.
This was in the early summer of 1861.</p>

<p>We regarded ourselves with more or less of
self-pity, as sleep-sacrificing heroes, who were
clearly entitled to a full day&#8217;s rest.</p>

<p>Jeb Stuart didn&#8217;t look at it in that way at
all. He was a soldier, while we were just beginning
to learn how to be soldiers. These
things make a difference.</p>

<p>We hadn&#8217;t got our tents pitched when he
ordered us out for a scouting expedition under
his personal command.</p>

<p>Our army lay at Winchester. The enemy
was at Martinsburg, twenty-two miles away.
Stuart, with his four or five hundred horsemen,
lay at Bunker Hill, about half-way between but
a little nearer to the enemy than to his supports.
That was always Stuart&#8217;s way.</p>

<p>In our scouting expedition that day, we had
two or three &#8220;brushes&#8221; with the enemy&mdash;&#8220;just
to get us used to it,&#8221; Stuart said.</p>

<p>Finally we went near to Martinsburg, and
came upon a farmhouse. The farm gave no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
appearance of being a large one, or one more
than ordinarily prosperous, yet we saw through
the open door a dozen or fifteen &#8220;farm hands&#8221;
eating dinner, all of them in their shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>Stuart rode up, with a few of us at his back,
to make inquiries, and we dismounted. Just
then a slip of a girl,&mdash;not over fourteen, I should
say&mdash;accompanied by a thick-set, young bull-dog,
with an abnormal development of teeth,
ran up to us.</p>

<p><i>She distinctly and unmistakably &#8220;sicked&#8221; that
dog upon us.</i> But as the beast assailed us, the
young girl ran after him and restrained his
ardor by throwing her arms around his neck.
As she did so, she kept repeating in a low but
very insistent tone to us: &#8220;Make &#8217;em put their
coats on! Make &#8217;em put their coats on! Make
&#8217;em put their coats on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stuart was a peculiarly ready person. He
said not one word to the young girl as she led
her dog away, but with a word or two he
directed a dozen or so of us to follow him with
cocked carbines into the dining-room. There
he said to the &#8220;farm hands&#8221;: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know
that a gentleman never dines without his coat?
Aren&#8217;t you ashamed of yourselves? And ladies
present, too! Get up and put on your coats,
every man jack of you, or I&#8217;ll riddle you with
bullets in five seconds.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sprang first of all into the hallway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
where they had left their arms; but either the
bull-dog or the fourteen-year-old girl had taken
care of that. The arms were gone. Then seeing
the carbines levelled, they made a hasty
search of the hiding-places in which they had
bestowed their coats. A minute later they
appeared as fully uniformed, but helplessly unarmed
Pennsylvania volunteers.</p>

<p>They were prisoners of war at once, without
even an opportunity to finish that good dinner.
As we left the house the young girl came up to
Stuart and said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t say anything about
it; but the dog wouldn&#8217;t have bit you. He
knows which side <i>we&#8217;re</i> on in this war.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we rode away this young girl&mdash;she of the
bull-dog&mdash;cried out: &#8220;To think the wretches
made us give &#8217;em dinner! And in their shirt-sleeves,
too!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LADY OF THE GREEN
BLIND</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE house looked a little bit odd, but we
made allowances for the times, although
this was in 1861, soon after the battle of Manassas.</p>

<p>There were seven windows in front, and they
all had white shades except one. That one had
a dark green Holland blind. We remarked on
the fact when the blind was put up, but we
thought little of it until we were instructed one
day to watch that blind at night and report its
doings.</p>

<p>There was a Federal picket post near the
house.</p>

<p>We reported many of the performances of
that blind without any visible results. But one
night it was suddenly drawn entirely down, having
before been rolled entirely to the top.
When that was reported to the company&#8217;s headquarters
under a tree, a little way in the rear,
the captain immediately ordered us to mount.</p>

<p>We rode at a swinging gallop up to the house,
and under quietly given orders seized the eleven
horses that were tied in the grounds. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
moment later a force of dismounted cavalrymen
came out of the house with a woman in charge.
It was pitch dark, even to us. To men right
from the light, and standing within the glare of
the doorway, the night must have been absolutely
blinding.</p>

<p>We could have shot down the whole detachment
without difficulty, but we understood in a
moment that there was a woman to be rescued,
and in a volley her danger would have been as
great as theirs.</p>

<p>We waited therefore for orders.</p>

<p>Then it was that the captain invented a totally
new cavalry man&#339;uvre, with a marching command
wholly unknown to the books on tactics.
He said to us in a low, quiet, but incisive voice:
&#8220;Form quickly in two single files; advance
and split the girl out. I&#8217;ll take her on my
crupper.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a pretty man&#339;uvre, and as Charlie
rode out between the two single files with the
young woman on the crupper, we cheered quite
as lustily as we fired. Then we didn&#8217;t know exactly
what to do. We had an appreciation of
the fact that Charlie wanted to get the woman
out of range as quickly as possible. But we
also had a realizing sense, drawn from experience,
of Charlie Irving&#8217;s extreme reluctance to
ride away from an enemy who could be faced.</p>

<p>It was Field Mann, the orderly sergeant, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
saw the right way out. He called out to us, in
quite unmilitary language: &#8220;Don&#8217;t retreat, boys,
Charlie&#8217;s sure to come back as soon&#8217;s he&#8217;s got
her safe; meantime we&#8217;ll fight &#8217;em. Form in
line under the cherry trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>We had them at a disadvantage. They were
still in the glare of light from the windows,
while we were in the darkness, and we were
sixty mounted men to eleven cavalrymen, whose
horses had been captured. Moreover we had
carbines, and they had none.</p>

<p>By the time we had made an alignment under
the trees, and before Field Mann could give
another order, the captain came running up on
foot, leaped into the saddle of one of the captured
horses, and quickly gave a command that
completely surrounded the house.</p>

<p>We had those men penned; but just then
their comrades at the neighboring picket post
discovered that there was trouble on hand, and
advanced upon us.</p>

<p>It was an exciting fight there in the darkness
and under the trees, so exciting that Stuart
quickly sent two other companies to our reinforcement.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour, we marched back
with some prisoners; the rest of our foes
had scattered and disappeared. When we got
to the camp-fires behind the hills, Charlie
Irving dismounted, and greeting the lady, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
was laboriously mending a torn gown with a
hairpin, said: &#8220;I hope you managed to ride
Selim? He&#8217;s a demon sometimes, and not at
all courteous to ladies. But there was nothing
for it but to trust you to him.&#8221; She murmured
something courteous in reply. Then turning
with blazing eyes to the Federal officer who
had been in command of the party, she asked:
&#8220;What were you going to do with me, if I
hadn&#8217;t been rescued?&#8221;</p>

<p>He replied: &#8220;I suppose you would have been
hanged as a spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was true.</p>

<p>After breakfast the next day&mdash;I remember
that breakfast consisted of some green corn
taken from a neighboring field and roasted in
the ashes with the husks on, and by the way
that&#8217;s the best way to cook green corn&mdash;we
escorted the lady back to her home, and under
Stuart&#8217;s orders stationed two cavalry companies
in front as a guard.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, I suppose, that the lady
was a spy, and that her green window blind
had communicated much valuable information.</p>

<p>But no; there was no courtship, no marriage,
no honeymoon, no romance, to follow. The
lady was forty-five, if a day; and besides that,
Irving was already engaged to a girl down
South.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">YOUNGBLOOD&#8217;S LAST
MORNING</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WE were all well used to seeing men shot,
but this was different.</p>

<p>It was a soft, warm, mellow autumn morning.
It was a day suggestive of all gentleness.
A purple, Indian-summer haze enveloped the
earthworks and the camps. Nature had issued
an invitation to peace and repose. The cannon
were not at work. Nobody on either side had
been tempted to bombard anybody else. Even
the mortars and the sharp-shooters were still.</p>

<p>It was not the kind of morning for the bloody
work of war.</p>

<p>Yet a young man was to be killed within the
hour. He was to be killed deliberately, in cold
blood, by sentence of a court-martial, and with
great pomp and ceremony; and nobody, even
in his heart, could say nay to the justice of the
sentence.</p>

<p>For Youngblood had done an infamous thing.</p>

<p>There were many desertions to the enemy
about that time. The war was manifestly drawing
to a close, and men who lacked self-sacrificing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
devotion were getting tired of its hardships
and privations. In order to stop these desertions,
orders had been issued that any soldier
arresting another in the act of going to the
enemy should have a thirty days&#8217; furlough.</p>

<p>Youngblood was on picket one day with
another man. He proposed to that other man
that they both should desert, and they started
together toward the enemy&#8217;s lines. According
to Youngblood&#8217;s story, it was his purpose to
arrest his comrade, and thus earn a furlough at
the expense of the other fellow&#8217;s life. Whether
this story was true or not doesn&#8217;t much matter.
The other fellow arrested him.</p>

<p>In any case, he deserved to pay the penalty
he did. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced.
The sentence was approved by all the authorities,
including the war department. This morning
it was to be carried out.</p>

<p>It was about ten o&#8217;clock, Youngblood&#8217;s regiment
was formed into three sides of a hollow
square. Near the entrance to the square, on
the right, rested Youngblood&#8217;s coffin. Beside
it was Youngblood&#8217;s grave.</p>

<p>Presently an ambulance drove up, bearing
the prisoner and his attendant guards. As he
stepped lightly and lithely from the ambulance,
we saw him to be a fine specimen of young
manhood. He was twenty-three or twenty-four
years of age; tall, well built, and full of elastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
vigor. He was handsome, too, and of refined
and gentle countenance.</p>

<p>There was no sign of flinching in him: nothing
that denoted the coward which his explanation
of his crime had shown him to be.</p>

<p>It seemed something more than a pity to put
a fellow like that to death.</p>

<p>He took his place in front of the guards and
just in rear of the band, and the dead march
began.</p>

<p>He walked alone.</p>

<p>Slowly, and with cadenced step, the procession
moved around inside the square. And as
it passed me, I was curious to observe the condemned
man&#8217;s behavior. His step was as steady
and as firm as that of any man in the guard. I
looked at his hands to see if there were any
convulsive clutching of the fingers. There was
none. I doubt if any man in all that regiment
felt so calm in mind or so well poised in nerve
as Youngblood looked.</p>

<p>Having completed the seemingly endless
march around the three closed sides of the
square, the procession turned to the right, and
crossed its open end to the point of execution.</p>

<p>There an officer stepped forward and read
to Youngblood the findings and sentence of the
court which had condemned him, with the
formal endorsements approving them and ordering
the sentence executed. The guard which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
had the prisoner in charge divided to the right
and left, and Youngblood was left standing
alone in front of his coffin, and beside his open
grave.</p>

<p>At the word of command he knelt upon the
coffin and folded his arms across his chest.
Again at the word of command twelve soldiers
stepped out in front of him with guns in their
hands. Six of these guns carried ball cartridges,
and six were blank. No man in the firing squad
was permitted to know whether his gun had a
bullet in it or not.</p>

<p>The officer in command spoke scarcely above
his breath, but so hushed was the time that his
words were audible to the three thousand men
there assembled, as he said to each alternate
man: &#8220;Fire at his head,&#8221; and to the intervening
man: &#8220;Fire at his chest.&#8221; Then turning his
back, which was perhaps not an officer-like
thing to do, the lieutenant gave in a husky
voice the word of command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready, aim, fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sharp crack from twelve rifles
fired simultaneously. There was a whirr and
whistle of six bullets that had passed through
the head or chest of the doomed man, and
hurtled off into the fields beyond. Army rifles
fire with tremendous force.</p>

<p>The dead man&#8217;s body rose to its feet and fell
limply forward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>Five minutes later all that was left of Youngblood
was buried beneath six feet of earth.</p>

<p>There was no merriment in any of the camps
that day, or the next, or the next. Even our
scant rations were not much relished by those
of us who had witnessed this scene.</p>

<p>And yet, as I said at the beginning, we were
all well used to seeing men killed.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">BILLY GOODWIN</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;NEVER have known whether Billy Goodwin
was a brave man or not.</p>

<p>He was certainly not afraid of anything; but
the absence of fear from his composition was so
complete that I was always in doubt whether
he was entitled to credit for never yielding to
that emotion.</p>

<p>His fearlessness seemed like the color of his
sandy hair and his pale blue eyes&mdash;something
over which he had no control.</p>

<p>At Cold Harbor, in 1864, when an artillery
duel was going on, plus a tremendous sharp-shooter
fire, Billy, with his back to the enemy,
lazily lounged upon the breastworks. All the
rest of us were crouching behind them.</p>

<p>I remember as an incident that he was eating
a sandwich. It was composed of two halves of
a hard-tack biscuit and a slice of raw pickled
pork&mdash;his entire rations for the day. He was
carefully holding his hand under his chin, in
order to save all the crumbs. We weren&#8217;t
wasting crumbs in those days.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>A lieutenant, who had already been mentioned
in orders for gallantry, cautiously pushed
up his head to peer over the breastworks on
which Goodwin was sitting. Billy placed his
hand upon the prematurely bald head of the
lieutenant, shoved him down, and said: &#8220;Keep
below the dirt, or you&#8217;ll get a bullet through
your billiard ball. Don&#8217;t you know this is no
time to be exposing yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>I have elsewhere celebrated Billy. In doing
so I have suggested that, while he had a high
sense of personal duty, he had no sense whatever
of personal danger.</p>

<p>On that terrible 30th of August, 1864, when
the mine was exploded at Petersburg, Goodwin
was detailed to act as courier for General Lee
and General Beauregard.</p>

<p>A Northern negro soldier had broken somehow
out of the crater and through the lines.
He rushed madly into headquarters. He struck
frantically at General Lee with his bayonet.
General Beauregard parried the blow with his
sword. The negro turned and ran out of the
door. Beauregard, in his excitement, called
out to Goodwin, &#8220;Go and kill that man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stepping quickly, as was his custom, Billy
gave pursuit. A few moments later he returned.
He presented himself in all his superb
length of limb. He gave the military salute to
General Beauregard. When that officer asked:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
&#8220;What is it, orderly?&#8221; Billy replied: &#8220;I beg
respectfully to report that I have killed that
man in accordance with orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was Billy. As a soldier he was a good
kind. He obeyed all orders without questioning
them. He did all his duties as he understood
them. But, as I have said, I have never
been able to determine whether he was really
a brave man, or whether he was merely a man
so constituted as to be insensible to personal
danger.</p>

<p>But I will say this for Billy, which may help
to decide this point,&mdash;</p>

<p>We were marching from Spottsylvania to
Cold Harbor. We marched for fifty-six hours
at the double quick. Now and then we had to
fight at the quadruple quick. We had no food.
We had no sleep. We had no rest.</p>

<p>Near the end of this tremendous strain Billy
came to me under a tree, where I was snatching
a five minutes&#8217; repose. He said, with an
air of great mystery: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a coon for my
mess. I bought it of a nigger back there. So
I don&#8217;t want this piece of corn-bread. I wish
you&#8217;d take it. I know you&#8217;re hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did not readily accept food from each
other in those days, lest we starve each
other.</p>

<p>I struggled to resist this proffer, but Billy
insisted on that coon as satisfying all his personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
wants. At last, therefore, I accepted the
three or four ounces of powder-grimed corn-bread
which he pressed upon me.</p>

<p>I learned afterwards that Billy had lied.</p>

<p>There wasn&#8217;t any coon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MANASSAS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;CALL it Manassas.</p>

<p>That is the name we Southerners gave it.
We won that battle more completely and more
conspicuously than any other battle was won
by either side during the Civil War.</p>

<p>It is the right of the victor always to name
the action. We named it Manassas. In the
North it is called Bull Run.</p>

<p>We reached Manassas after two days and
nights of ceaseless marching, at ten o&#8217;clock on
the evening of the 20th of July, 1861.</p>

<p>We knew that trouble was at hand; otherwise
Stuart would not have swung us at such
a breakneck speed across the mountains from
the valley to this point. We were six hundred
strong.</p>

<p>Six hundred young Virginians, cradled in the
saddle, and who had shot wild turkeys as soon
as we were able to digest them. There was
another battalion of cavalry present, under
Colonel Radford, numbering perhaps three
hundred men. But the story had gone forth
in the Northern army that we were thirty thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
of the finest horsemen ever known since
the days of the Mamelukes.</p>

<p>That story had its part in creating the panic
at Manassas.</p>

<p>I believe we were good horsemen. There
were men among us who might have given the
Mamelukes points, both in horsemanship and
in the use of the sabre. But if our nine hundred
men had been the thirty thousand reported,
we should have thundered into Washington on
the night of Sunday, July 21, 1861, and would
have ended the war then and there, in spite
of the presidential stupidity which feared that
&#8220;aggression&#8221; might anger a people with whom
we were at war.</p>

<p>We lay that night in an open field, each man
having his horse tethered to his left arm, and
each man booted, spurred, sabred, and pistolled
for instant action.</p>

<p>The bugle sounded no reveille that morning.
A shell from the enemy&#8217;s camp, which fell in
the midst of the regiment, saved the bugler the
trouble.</p>

<p>With a laugh, which was almost a chuckle,
Stuart called out: &#8220;That&#8217;s &#8216;boots and saddles,&#8217;
boys,&#8221; and in an instant we were on our
horses.</p>

<p>The first great battle of the war had begun.</p>

<p>It was not until noon, or nearly that, that the
cavalry had any real work to do. I didn&#8217;t look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
at my watch, but it must have been about noon
when Stuart swept us at a tremendous pace
through a regiment or two of Zouaves, and back
again over the same ground. I saw no Zouaves
for the reason that there was too much dust to
see anything; but it was understood when the
charge was over, that we had driven them back.
And half a dozen empty saddles in our own
ranks attested the fact that they had not been
driven back without a stubborn and manly resistance.</p>

<p>A little later, we cavalrymen were ordered
up to the support of some batteries that had
temporarily run out of ammunition. Our reputation
as Mamelukes sufficed at that point to
prevent a charge, so that our real work in the
battle did not begin until the panic in McDowell&#8217;s
army set in.</p>

<p>Then Stuart rose in his stirrups and shouted
at the top of his voice: &#8220;They&#8217;re licked, boys!
They&#8217;re licked! They&#8217;re licked!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then hastily he rattled off orders. The substance
of them was that we were to divide the
cavalry into squads of ten and twenty men each,
and proceed at once in pursuit.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there aren&#8217;t officers, and non-commissioned
officers enough, let anybody command a
squad. This is business.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the several squads started at a gallop
after the enemy, Stuart called out to each:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
&#8220;Attack any force you find. There is no cohesion
left among &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>In that command he struck the key-note of
the whole situation. Seasoned soldier that he
was, he knew that without cohesion, soldiers
are helpless, and numbers count for nothing.</p>

<p>We plunged forward across every ford and
along every road that led from Bull Run towards
Centreville. At every point we found &#8220;chaos
come again.&#8221;</p>

<p>A squad of ten men, armed only with sabres
and pistols, but backed by the Mameluke tradition,
would call out to eighty or a hundred fully
armed infantry: &#8220;Throw down your arms, or
we&#8217;ll put you to the sword! Throw down your
arms, or we&#8217;ll put you to the sword!&#8221;</p>

<p>The panic-stricken men would obey the order
instantly, disregarding the fact that with a single
volley they might have swept the insolent squad
instantly out of existence.</p>

<p>It was not merely that the army was panic
stricken. It was encumbered at every step by
a multitude of embarrassing picnickers,&mdash;a multitude
of men and women who had come out
from Washington to see us exterminated and to
join in a triumphal march to Richmond. These
people had brought out with them more superfluous
provisions than our army had eaten for a
fortnight. They abandoned their luxuries in
the middle of the road and ran. They left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
champagne enough unopened for a regiment to
swim in. They fled precipitately, adding at
every step by their own insensate fear to the
panic that had already overtaken the troops.</p>

<p>Men cut horses out of vehicles that held helpless
women, and madly mounting them abandoned
their charges and their duties, in order
to escape a present and impending danger to
themselves. Fortunately for their charges, the
Southerners were not making war on women.</p>

<p>Every woman was instantly assured of her
own personal safety. Every horse that was
left behind was hitched at once to a vehicle,
and the vehicle loaded with women was started
under an assurance of safe conduct towards
Washington. When the supply of abandoned
horses fell short, it was made good by animals
from our batteries, and now and then by the
riderless horse of one of the Mamelukes who
had received a mortal wound.</p>

<p>Along the roads we found many dead men,
for whose deaths no coroner would have been
able to account&mdash;men utterly destitute of
wounds, who had died clearly either of fright,
or of exhaustion, or of both.</p>

<p>At Cub Run, an ambulance or a caisson broke
down on the bridge and obstructed it. The
obstruction almost instantly caused a congestion
of two or three thousand panic-stricken soldiers
and picnickers on the hither side of the stream.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>Then came Kemper with his guns. He was
as black as a negro with powder smoke. His
cannoneers were equally begrimed. From the
top of a hill, not more than two hundred
yards distant,&mdash;pistol-shot range,&mdash;he opened
fire with canister. The effect upon the crowd
was instantaneous and almost startling. Its
constituent members dispersed as a covey of
partridges does when a shot-gun is fired into its
lurking place. Some of them ran up the creek.
Some of them ran down the creek. Some of
them plunged into the creek, and crossed or
drowned, as the case may be.</p>

<p>It was just then that Stuart rode up and
cried out: &#8220;We&#8217;ll go into Washington to-night,
boys. And my headquarters will be at Willard&#8217;s
Hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was just then also that couriers came, bearing
the paralyzing presidential order to stop the
pursuit at Cub Run.</p>

<p>It was just then that the despondency of the
Mamelukes began.</p>

<p>A little later it rained.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MY LAST NIGHT ON PICKET</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MY period of service in the cavalry was
about to expire. I was not tired of the
cavalry service; on the contrary, I was very
much in love with it. Any full-blooded man
must have been so under such leadership as
Stuart&#8217;s.</p>

<p>But for reasons pertaining to Joe, I had
sought and obtained a transfer to the artillery.</p>

<p>Joe was just sixteen.</p>

<p>The infantry regiment in which he had gone
out had been so cut to pieces in a fierce fight
that it was dissolved. Joe and a bullet-riddled
flag were about all there was left of it.</p>

<p>Therefore Joe had enlisted in a battery of
artillery. He was as brave a fellow as is made,
and as cantankerous and self-assertive as a
brave boy is apt to be. I felt it necessary to
be with him to keep him from being unnecessarily
killed or court-martialled, and to exercise
over him that mature, paternal influence which
the superior age of twenty-one justified.</p>

<p>This was my last night of cavalry service.
It was late autumn in 1861. The company was
ordered on picket at Fairfax Court House. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
enemy was very urgent just then, and gave us
a good deal of trouble on the picket lines.</p>

<p>I was ordered to a post underneath a very
broad and low spreading tree, so that when I
sat upon my horse I was not visible from the
thicket in front, and would not have been even
if it had been broad daylight.</p>

<p>That thicket was full of sharp-shooters, and
when I went on post about seven o&#8217;clock in the
evening, I was instructed to preserve absolute
silence in self-protection, and warned that it
would probably not be possible to relieve me
until morning.</p>

<p>My mare was a restless creature at ordinary
times, but she had learned the whole art of
picket duty. If I had been anywhere else, she
would have champed the bit, and pawed the
ground, and snorted in her restlessness. Standing
there at night, with a bullet whistling over
her head every minute or two, she was as still
as the traditional mouse.</p>

<p>I sat there all night on her back with pistols
drawn, and in a silence such as nobody but a
picket thus placed ever maintains.</p>

<p>Just as the day was dawning, or rather just
as the gray in the eastern sky began to suggest
the possibility of dawn, a sergeant crawling on
his belly approached me from the rear. In a
whisper I called out, &#8220;Who goes there?&#8221; He,
also in a whisper, let me know his identity. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
had come to order my withdrawal from the
post.</p>

<p>Not until we had reached a point a hundred
yards in the rear was anything further said.
There I found the company drawn up in line
with Charlie Irving at its head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many shots from the thicket?&#8221; asked
Charlie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two or three to the minute,&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;throughout the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;we&#8217;ll scoop those
fellows in; they&#8217;re getting to be obnoxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then in a low tone he told us precisely what
we were to do, and we were to do it without
further orders. He was to lead, of course, but
he wanted to give as few commands as possible,
in order to make his movement successful.</p>

<p>Silently we moved off over the soft turf to
the left. Crossing the road below the thicket
we struck a gallop and quickly surrounded the
space occupied by the sharp-shooters. It was
the work of but a few minutes to close in upon
and capture them. Two of our saddles were
emptied in the operation, and five of the sharp-shooters
were left unburied in the brush; the
rest we took with us to headquarters, another
company having replaced us on picket.</p>

<p>Among the prisoners was one little fellow,
apparently not over fifteen or sixteen years of
age. His features were clear cut and delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
and his clothing was worn as if it had belonged
to somebody else.</p>

<p>When we had got well to the rear and the
daylight was broad, Charlie Irving looked at
the little fellow and said: &#8220;How old are you,
my boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-two,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but I&#8217;m a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>That girl was sent back under a flag of truce.
We didn&#8217;t know what else to do with her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">GRIFFITH&#8217;S CONTINUED STORY</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was in the early summer of 1864. We
were in the trenches at Spottsylvania.</p>

<p>It had been raining continuously all day,
with now and then a heavy downpour, just to
remind us that a little rain ought not to matter
to old soldiers. By the use of fragments of fence
rail and such other sticks as we could secure
to stand upon, we managed to avoid sinking
below our ankles into the soft, red, Virginian
mud.</p>

<p>It was a little after two o&#8217;clock in the morning,
but we were all awake and on duty. For
it was not General Grant&#8217;s purpose at that time
to allow us much of repose. We had stood in
the trenches and in the rain all day, and we
must stand in the trenches and in the rain all
night, and as much longer as it might please
the enemy to keep us there.</p>

<p>The night was one of the blackest I have
ever known. There was no possibility of sending
couriers anywhere, and all orders had, therefore,
to be passed from mouth to mouth up and
down the lines.</p>

<p>Every few minutes a great downpour of bucketfuls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
would come; and, worse still, every now
and then the enemy would rush forward in the
darkness and come upon us at pistol-shot range
without notice.</p>

<p>It was Ulysses S. Grant we were fighting,
and that was the line on which he was going
to &#8220;fight it out, if it took all summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>We felt the need of entertainment, so somebody
called out to a sergeant: &#8220;Tell us a
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Johnny Garrett, &#8220;let Griffith
tell a story, for he never finishes, and this is
a long night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The suggestion was applauded and insisted
upon. Whether Griffith blushed or not, it was
much too dark to see; but after a little chaffing
he consented to tell the story. Just as he
began Billy Goodwin, who always wanted to
gamble on everything, offered to bet three to
one that he would never finish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, Goodwin,&#8221; said Johnny Garrett,
&#8220;and let him begin, anyhow. If he don&#8217;t get
through by the middle of the night, I&#8217;ll negotiate
the bet with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon Griffith began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, &#8217;taint much of a story&mdash;only a bear
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bet two to one he never gets to the bear,&#8221;
said the incorrigible Goodwin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet, will you?&#8221; cried some one at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
right of the company. The man next to him
mistook this adjuration for a command sent
down the line; so, to the astonishment of everybody
to the left of us, the word was passed from
mouth to mouth: &#8220;<i>Be quiet, will you! Be
quiet, will you! Be quiet, will you!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Griffith, &#8220;&#8217;twas about six year
ago, or maybe seven. No, lemme see&mdash;&#8217;twas
the same year that Jim Coffee married Mirandy
Adams. Must have been eight year
ago, I s&#8217;pose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then came the order down the line:
&#8220;Perfect silence! Enemy advancing!&#8221;</p>

<p>The next minute a line of bayonets broke
out of the fog in front of us, and a flaring fire
blazed forth in our faces. The charge upon us
was a determined one, and for full three minutes
it required all our efforts to repel it. After
that the artillery silenced all conversation by
pouring a shower of shot and shell into the
retiring assailants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still ready to make that bet,&#8221; said Billy
Goodwin. But Griffith began again undaunted.
He was a phlegmatic person, whose mind was
never driven from its not very large purposes by
any shock&mdash;even that of a shower of canister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as I wuz a-sayin&#8217;, it wuz about six or
eight year ago&mdash;it don&#8217;t really matter, I s&#8217;pose,
how long ago it wuz&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Billy Goodwin, &#8220;let her rip.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;Well, as I wuz a-sayin&#8217;&mdash;&#8221; Just then the
enemy charged again.</p>

<p>Griffith had captured a Henry rifle two days
before, in the battle of the Wilderness, and it
was loaded with fourteen ball cartridges. With
that deliberation which characterized him in
everything, he delivered those fourteen shots
in the face of the enemy, who by that time
had retired. Then he turned and began to fill
the magazine of his rifle again, saying: &#8220;Well,
you see, as I wuz a-sayin&#8217;, Peter Coffee he taken
a cawntract for a bridge over Tye River. Now
Peter always pertended that he knew how to
lay out bridge work. Of course I knew better.
I&#8217;d been to Fletcher Massie&#8217;s school with him,
and I knew just how little &#8217;rithmetic he knew.
Fletch, he carried me through the rule o&#8217; three,
and you can&#8217;t lay out bridge work till you&#8217;ve
<i>bin</i> through the rule o&#8217; three.&#8221;</p>

<p>The day was dawning, and just then came an
order for us to move to the right, the extreme
right, four or five miles away. We marched at
once. Grant was making his celebrated move
by the left flank.</p>

<p>When we got into position, it was necessary
to throw up such earthworks as we could with
our bayonets, using fence rails for revetments.
This occupied us during most of the day, and
scattered as we were, we were not able to listen
to the remainder of Griffith&#8217;s story.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>That afternoon, to our surprise, we received a
ration of three-quarters of a pound of flour to
each man. When we had baked it, I happened
to go by Tom Booker&#8217;s position and saw
him eating the entire cake. Tom looked at me
pitifully as I remonstrated with him for eating
three days&#8217; rations in advance, and he said with
tears in his voice if not in his eyes: &#8220;I know it,
but I&#8217;m go&#8217;n&#8217; t&#8217; fill my stomach once, if I starve
for it. I <i>wish</i> I was a woman or a baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later came the order to move;
our battery was at that time unhorsed. It had
been planned to leave it in the rear, because its
guns could not be moved for lack of horses, but
with one voice the men had demanded the privilege
of taking rifles and going with the battalion
as sharp-shooters.</p>

<p>On this march the battalion was the rear
guard of the army, and our rifle-armed battery
was the rear guard of the battalion.</p>

<p>For fifty-six hours we marched without food
or sleep, pausing every fifteen minutes to fight
awhile, and then double-quicking to catch up.</p>

<p>There was no chance for Griffith in all this.
But when we got to Cold Harbor, and went into
the works, Billy Goodwin at a favorable moment
insisted that he should resume his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see I&#8217;ve got three bets on it,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>Just then a grape-shot passed through George
Campbell&#8217;s foot, and distracted our attention for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
a time. Then came General Field, who ordered
us to burn a barn in front that was full of
sharp-shooters. The first two or three shots
from the battalion did the business. The sharp-shooters
ran with all their might across a thousand
yards of space, while we poured upon
them the sharpest rifle fire we could deliver.
Some of them got to cover, and some of them
didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>It was not till we moved to Bottom&#8217;s Bridge
that Griffith had a chance to resume his story.
There we were all sick from having eaten boiled
potato vines, for lack of other food. Being too
ill to go to sleep, we demanded a continuation
of the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as I wuz a-sayin&#8217;,&#8221; said Griffith, &#8220;I&#8217;d
gone clean through the rule o&#8217; three in Fletch
Massie&#8217;s school, and Peter Coffee he knew it.
As I told yuh, he&#8217;d taken the cawntract to lay
out this bridge work; so he got his wife to write
to me to come up and do the &#8217;rithmetic. Well,
just as I wuz startin&#8217; up, Bill Linsey says to me,&mdash;you
know he kept a store down there at Arrington,
he says to me, says he, &#8216;Griffith, there&#8217;s
a runlet o&#8217; cider that&#8217;s got twenty gallon in it.
Can you lif&#8217; it?&#8217; I says, &#8216;Yes, I can lif&#8217; it and
drink out o&#8217; the bung, if you&#8217;ll let me drink es
much es I please.&#8217; I lifted it and took a big
swallow of the sweet stuff, then I says, &#8216;I can
carry it up the mountain,&#8217; says I, and he says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
says he, &#8216;On your back?&#8217; says he, an&#8217; I says,
&#8216;Yes, on my back,&#8217; says I. An&#8217; he says, says
he, &#8216;Well, you can have it ef you&#8217;ll agree to
carry it up the mountain on your back, and not
take no lift frum nobody.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a battery, three thousand yards
away, opened on us, and we had to run to
cover, every man of us with his hands on his
stomach, in physical memory of the potato
vines. Our guns were not in position, and all
we could do was to ensconce ourselves behind
big trees. As the artillery fire kept up, General
Alexander rode to this point of the lines
and ordered up three batteries of rifled cannon;
by the time they had finished their little
controversy with the enemy, we had recovered
from the potato tops sufficiently to go to sleep.
So Griffith&#8217;s story was to be &#8220;continued in our
next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our &#8220;next&#8221; came only after we got to Petersburg.
There our battery took charge of the
mortars of the army. Griffith was one of the
men I selected when asked to volunteer for a
particularly perilous mortar service. He might
or might not be able to tell a story, but he could
stand fire as well as any man I ever knew.</p>

<p>About four o&#8217;clock one morning, when we
had been engaged in a fierce bombardment all
night, the fire ceased for a time, and Billy
Goodwin demanded the rest of that bear story.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>&#8220;You see I&#8217;ve got seven bets on that story,&#8221;
said Billy, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t want to win any man&#8217;s
money unfairly. One bet is that he won&#8217;t ever
get to the bear, and I don&#8217;t want to take any
man&#8217;s money without givin&#8217; him a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, wait a minute,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;till I start
up the fire; we&#8217;ve got to have some breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fire was out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody must go up,&#8221; I said, &#8220;to the next
fort and get a chunk of fire. It won&#8217;t do to get
fire by shooting a mortar,&#8221;&mdash;which was our
usual way,&mdash;&#8220;because if we do that, we&#8217;ll start
this bombardment again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said Griffith, &#8220;and then I&#8217;ll tell the
rest of that story.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a fearful hail of bullets between
the two forts. The cannon were silent, but the
musketry fire was incessant. Griffith started
off, crouching as he went up the path so as to
expose as little as possible of his person.</p>

<p>That was the last I ever saw of him.</p>

<p>As he was borne off on the litter, he sent
word to me that he &#8220;hoped I hadn&#8217;t any bets
on that bear story.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A CHEERFUL SUPPER OF
CHEERS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS Commissary it was Haskell&#8217;s business to
see to it that we had plenty to eat; but
the seven days&#8217; fights below Richmond were on,
and Haskell was, first of all, a fighter,&mdash;a thing
uncommon in Commissaries and Quartermasters.</p>

<p>Instead of attending to his pork and meal
wagons in the rear, he went to the front.</p>

<p>There he was active in a degree that commanded
the respect of his general. He interested
himself so much in the movements of
troops, and in the controversy with the enemy,
that he forgot all about the wagons.</p>

<p>In this service he had his right arm shot off
by a cannon-ball.</p>

<p>When night came, and we wanted something
to eat, there was a good deal of growling because
we had nothing. But when the story
was told of how our Commissary had fought,
and how he had lost an arm in the fighting, a
fellow with more humor than appetite got up
and cried: &#8220;I move that we sup on three cheers
and a tiger for the Commissary that fights.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three cheers were given.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>As soon as his wound was healed, Haskell was
made a major and placed in command of the
battalion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW THE TAR HEELS STUCK</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE sergeant-major sat there on his horse
in the drenching rain. There was nothing
to do but to endure. The three days of
fighting in the Wilderness in that early summer
of 1864, and the three nights of sleeplessness
had considerably undone his nerves.</p>

<p>But for the first time in his life he realized
that he had a hope at least for an opportunity.
He had a lieutenant&#8217;s command. He
hoped for a chance to make himself a lieutenant,
in fact. With two guns, twenty-six men, and
twenty-four horses under his command, and
wholly detached from his battery, he had hope,
that gray foggy morning, that he might have an
opportunity. Yet here he was, standing behind a
hill, soaking wet, and with no apparent prospect.</p>

<p>Three times the infantry had been ordered
forward to the top of that hill. Three times
they had been swept away as with a broom.</p>

<p>The hill was clearly untenable.</p>

<p>Then came General Alexander.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you nerve, courage, backbone? Do
you want an opportunity?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant-major answered, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;Then take your guns to the top of that hill
and <span class="allsmcap">STAY THERE</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant-major gave the necessary orders,
and advanced at once, feeling that he and his
men were lambs sent to the slaughter.</p>

<p>When he appeared on top of the hill, twenty
batteries and ten thousand riflemen opened upon
him. But his orders were to &#8220;stay there,&#8221; and
the sergeant-major wanted to be a lieutenant.</p>

<p>His horse sank under him at the first fire.
His men went down like grass before the
scythe.</p>

<p>But he <span class="allsmcap">STAYED THERE</span>.</p>

<p>About that time a North Carolina general
rode up to his brigade and called aloud: &#8220;Men,
are you going to allow these guns to be captured?
They say we North Carolinians have
tar on our heels; let&#8217;s show them that tar <i>sticks</i>.
Forward! March!&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes later that hill was occupied by
three thousand North Carolinians, the tar on
whose heels STUCK. Half a dozen more batteries
were ordered up, and the young sergeant-major
was directed to move his guns by hand
to the rear.</p>

<p><i>By hand.</i> Because of his twenty-four horses
only two remained alive; while there were only
thirteen left out of his twenty-six men to handle
the guns by hand. This is what we called
&#8220;life&#8221; in the Confederate army.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">&#8220;LITTLE LAMKIN&#8217;S BATTERY&#8221;</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">FOR twenty-four hours I had had a man on
my mind.</p>

<p>He had been court-martialled and was sentenced
to be shot. He was in the guardhouse.</p>

<p>I know of no good reason why I should have
objected to his execution; he certainly deserved
all that he was to get. But I had been his
counsel before the court-martial, and it is never
a pleasant thing for a lawyer to have his client
executed.</p>

<p>He belonged officially to me. I had assumed
a responsibility for him, and I felt that it would
not be fully discharged if he should be led out
and shot.</p>

<p>I had known Beavers for a very brief time;
but as his counsel I had learned much from him
in confidence as to his career. He was a person
of elective affinities. It was his habit to desert.
He had served on both sides and in many
capacities. He always fought well on whichever
side he might happen to be serving. As a
gambler, he always &#8220;played his game for all it
was worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why he had deserted back and forth in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
way without any cogent reason, I never knew.
I used to think sometimes that he had done so
at first just to try how a new style and color of
uniform might suit his particular kind of beauty.
His beauty was not in itself conspicuous.</p>

<p>I learned from him incidentally that his
various reasons for desertion from one side
to the other had not been of a kind that would
have controlled the action of a less fastidious
man.</p>

<p>On one occasion he had deserted because
he smelt mutton from the camp-kettles of the
enemy. He had a predilection for mutton.</p>

<p>I learned that he returned to us once, because
one night, when he was not quite himself, a
comrade had put him to bed and reversed the
order of his blankets. Beavers explained to
me with great particularity that a certain gray
blanket had been placed on top of a certain
brown one. He could not be expected to remain
with a regiment under such conditions.</p>

<p>At last he had been caught in the act of deserting.
He had been tried, and, in spite of such
legal acumen as I could bring to bear, had been
convicted, sentenced, and the next day but one
was to be shot.</p>

<p>Now that he was sure to die, he seemed to
make no more of the fact than of any other
indifferent thing. I do not mean that he was
careless of his fate. He took everything seriously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
But facts were to him facts, and he did
not worry over them. He did not think it
worth while.</p>

<p>So when he was sentenced to death, he adjusted
his blankets in the proper order so that
he might not have a nightmare, and slept the
sleep of the contented.</p>

<p>With all my contempt for Beavers I was
sorry that he was to die. There was something
in the reckless character of the man that appealed
to me. Something that made me feel
that it was a pity that this abundant life should
be extinguished by a rifle shot.</p>

<p>I had been thinking all night. I had thought
of every argument in his favor. I had searched
my mind to see if any point had been neglected.
Early in the night I had gone to Beavers, and
asked him for the aid of suggestion&mdash;suggestion
that might lead to information. But here
again his habits balked me. He said: &#8220;I&#8217;m
gambling in this case on your brains.&#8221;</p>

<p>I might myself have been willing to do that,
but I was gambling with Beavers&#8217;s life for a
stake.</p>

<p>Beavers was of course just that kind of man,
whom a self-respecting person feels it his duty
to despise; but somehow I could not quite despise
Beavers. His coolness appealed to me
strongly. His bravado seemed a sort of bravery.
His readiness to meet the consequences,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
and pay the penalties of his own misdeeds, was
a thing hard to distinguish from heroism.</p>

<p>He had no principles, of course. He did not
pretend to have any. But he had certain methods
of thought which seemed to serve him in
lieu of principles.</p>

<p>It was just before dawn. I had not slept.
As I lay in my tent with the flaps thrown back,
all that was discernible was the rather spectral-looking
tented city with its precise white rows.
I had become so nervous, staring through the
dark at the place where I knew the tent pole to
be, that at last I turned out for good. I tightened
my belt. It was our habit to sleep in our
clothes&mdash;for reasons.</p>

<p>The first gray of the morning touched the
camp, and looking down the row I saw a
fragile figure moving from one tent to another,
and pausing occasionally in uncertainty. At
first I could not be certain whether it was a
woman or not. Finally the figure straightened
up and stood looking towards the guardhouse;
it was that of a woman.</p>

<p>I had not seen a woman in two months.</p>

<p>The camp was silent with that quietude that
is so impressive just before the dawn.</p>

<p>After staring at the guardhouse for a
moment, while I stood staring at her, the
woman turned her eyes and we stood looking
at each other. After halting a moment she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
came staggering up the narrow lane between
the two rows of tents, making a peculiar,
nervous movement with her hands, but saying
nothing. She stood for a few moments a little
way from the tent door, clasping and unclasping
her hands.</p>

<p>I saw that she was ill. She reeled up against
the tent pole, and would have fallen had I not
caught her by the arm. I seated her on a log,
all the seat there was. After a moment she
revived a little, and said in a faint voice,
&#8220;Beavers.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment reveille sounded. The
woman was too evidently ill for me to leave
her. I sent a sergeant to attend the roll-call.
I directed our cook to provide the woman with
coffee and food.</p>

<p>Then I questioned her a little. She had
walked twenty-two miles over railroad ties.</p>

<p>She was Beavers&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p>She said to me: &#8220;You are his counsel, I
believe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;and I have done everything
I could to save him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you have not,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You
have not made the point that he was never
legally enlisted as a soldier, I&#8217;ll warrant! He&#8217;s
over forty-five and can&#8217;t be conscribed. He
was pardoned out of the penitentiary on condition
that he should enlist, but the court-martial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
had no proof of that. There&#8217;s nothing whatever
to show that he&#8217;s a soldier; and if he ain&#8217;t
a soldier, he can&#8217;t be punished for desertion.
I&#8217;ve come to tell you, for he would never think
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I jumped to my feet. I called a sentinel,
and told him to take the woman to the guardhouse
and make her as comfortable as possible.
I mounted my horse and galloped to the station.
I roused the telegraph operator two hours before
his time. He was a sleepy fellow, but he
was accustomed to taking imperative messages
out of hours. I gave him this one to the war
department:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beavers to be shot to-morrow morning. No proof
whatever he was ever soldier. If not soldier, could not
have deserted. Too old for conscript law, and no proof
of enlistment except Governor Letcher&#8217;s telegram. Telegram
not under oath, not legal testimony. Witness not
subjected to cross-examination. As counsel, I demand
stay in this man&#8217;s case.</p>
</div>

<p>I rode back to the guardhouse, and found
that a new member had been added to the
battery. The company was known as Lamkin&#8217;s
Battery.</p>

<p>We named the new member &#8220;<i>Little</i> Lamkin&#8217;s
Battery,&#8221; to distinguish it, I suppose, from the
big one.</p>

<p>Beavers sat all that morning with his wife&#8217;s
hand in his, and Little Lamkin&#8217;s Battery in
his arms.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>He said it looked like its mother. He&#8217;d
&#8220;gamble on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not until within an hour of the time appointed
for Beavers&#8217;s execution did there come a reply
from the war department. But when it came
it was thoroughly satisfactory. It read thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Legal points conclusive. Release Beavers and restore
him to duty. Duplicate sent to General Walker.</p>
</div>

<p>Soon after that Beavers deserted, blankets
and all, to &#8220;the other enemy&#8221;&mdash;that was his
form of speech, not mine.</p>

<p>The next time I saw him was under peculiar
circumstances.</p>

<p>In July, 1865, I went on board the steamer
<i>Morning Star</i>, at Portland, four miles below
Louisville, Kentucky.</p>

<p>I was two or three hours in advance of the
sailing of the boat. Only a few people were
scattered about the front of the cabin. I went
to the clerk, paid for my room and passage,
and pocketed thirty dollars in change. A moment
later the porter came in with my trunk.
I put my hand in my vest pocket to get the
dollar due him, but found my thirty dollars
gone.</p>

<p>I had all the feelings which a man always has
when he finds that his pocket has been picked&mdash;which
include the feeling of helplessness.</p>

<p>There was on board a brigade of troops
going South. They were late enlisters, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
had seen none of the fighting. The men were
on the deck below, of course. The officers,
though their transportation orders called only
for deck passage, were by courtesy permitted
in the cabin. There were a dozen or twenty of
them, mainly rough lumbermen, or something
of that kind. They evidently wanted to see
a fight. So they concluded to pick that fight
with me.</p>

<p>One of them came up to me where I was
reading a novel, and began the trouble by saying:
&#8220;You&#8217;re a rebel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;I was a rebel while the
rebellion lasted, but I have taken the oath of
allegiance, and am at present a loyal citizen of
the United States.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you <i>were</i> a rebel,&#8221; he said, with more
offence in his tone than in his words; &#8220;and I
want to know what you are doing here in the
North.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in the North,&#8221; I replied; &#8220;but in the
middle of a river that separates the North from
the South.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time half a dozen others of the crowd
had gathered in front of me with angry faces.
It was manifestly their purpose to make trouble,
and I saw no use in trying to ward it off. They
were planning a fight; and whether it was to be
a safe one or not, it seemed to me a good time
to begin it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>I sprang to my feet and faced them. I
was utterly unarmed, while they carried their
weapons. I grasped a chair as the only means
of defence at hand, and with remarks which
are better not repeated, perhaps, told them to
come on.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a stateroom door opened
behind me, and two warm hands thrust two
pistols into my grasp. The next moment a
stalwart figure, armed in the same way, stood
beside me, and, presenting two pistols, called
out: &#8220;Hands up, gentlemen! The first man
that moves dies. You&#8217;re twenty to two of us,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Some language followed.</p>

<p>The men threw up their hands.</p>

<p>Without taking his eyes off his adversaries
or lowering his weapons, my comrade called
out: &#8220;Mr. Clerk, send for the captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the captain came, my comrade reported
that these men had made an unwarranted
assault upon an inoffensive passenger,
and said: &#8220;They have no business in the cabin,
anyway. As a first-class passenger, I call on
you to send &#8217;em below, where they belong.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain was willing enough. He had
been three times arrested during the war for
aiding &#8220;rebel sympathizers.&#8221; A minute later
these officers had become deck passengers.</p>

<p>Then I turned to my deliverer, and to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
astonishment he was Beavers. He had grown
stout, and was resplendent in a suit of clothes
with checks so broad that it might easily have
taken two persons to show the pattern; otherwise
he was the same old nonchalant, reckless
Beavers, ready to gamble upon any chance and
to pay his losses though the payment might be
with his life.</p>

<p>I made my identity known to him of course.
He replied immediately: &#8220;Why, of course, I
reckonized you long before this thing occurred,
and I have been trying to get an excuse for
speaking to you. Because you see when you
came aboard in mufti I didn&#8217;t know who you
was, and so I lifted thirty dollars out of your
clothes. I wouldn&#8217;t have done it if I&#8217;d a&#8217; known
it was you, and now I want to hand it back. I
could just as easily have picked that other fellow&#8217;s
pocket&mdash;the one that picked the quarrel
with you. I never go back on my friends,
never! And I&#8217;ve never forgot how you got me
out of that scrape.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed me back the thirty dollars and I
thanked him. He said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it.&#8221;
He added, though I never knew what he meant
by it: &#8220;I&#8217;ll square the whole thing with that
other feller. He&#8217;s got more&#8217;n thirty dollars in
<i>his</i> wad.&#8221;</p>

<p>I naturally felt a little warm towards Beavers.
I owed him my life. Therefore when he suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
some alcoholic celebration of the incident
I compromised on a cigar. However little you
may esteem a man, it is difficult to snub him a
few minutes after he has saved your life.</p>

<p>Beavers went to the baggage-master and said
something to him which I didn&#8217;t hear. The
baggage-master shook his head in dissent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Beavers; &#8220;it&#8217;s five
dollars to you, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, that&#8217;s different,&#8221; said the baggage-master,
and two minutes later Beavers was
searching one of his trunks. Presently he came
up with a wad of papers in his hand and we returned
to the cabin. There he spread out some
architectural designs for a gorgeous monument,
and said: &#8220;Look at that. That&#8217;s the design of
the monument I&#8217;ve just put up over that wife of
mine. She was a mighty good sort, and I&#8217;ve
spent good money to give her a proper send-off.
I&#8217;ve paid five thousand dollars to the architect
for the design, and fifteen thousand dollars to
have it built. You see business is good with
me just now. I&#8217;ve got a faro bank at Louisville
and another at Evansville and two at Cairo, and
another at St. Louis, and three at Memphis and
one at Vicksburg, and two at New Orleans. As
for me I <i>run the river and make what there is in
it</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought occurred to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
about Little Lamkin&#8217;s Battery? Well, he&#8217;s on
board.&#8221; Beckoning to a negro nurse, he said:
&#8220;Bring that little rascal here.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later the nurse returned, having
a peculiarly bright, three-year-old boy in
charge, whom I greeted as an old friend. After
talking with the little chap for a few moments
I turned to Beavers and said: &#8220;What are you
going to make out of him, Beavers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something better than his father is,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;for his mothers sake; and that reminds
me you&#8217;re just out of the war and you&#8217;ve got
your way to make. It won&#8217;t do for you to know
<i>me</i>. If you ever meet me goin&#8217; up and down
the river, I&#8217;ll cut you dead and don&#8217;t you say
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CURRY</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">CURRY was our mess cook.</p>

<p>He was a great rascal, but one of the best
cooks in the world. And besides he was discriminative
in his rascality. He never did any
dishonest thing towards us; but he was capable
of any conceivable crime, if he could commit it
in our behalf.</p>

<p>He was a pure-blooded negro of the brown or
semi-copper-colored variety. He was without a
trace of beard, as that variety of negro usually
is. His voice was a falsetto.</p>

<p>His devotion was dog-like. If the state of
South Carolina held anything that his mess
needed, and there was any conceivable way in
which it could be got, he got it. Frankly without
morals,&mdash;unless devotion to his mess was
a moral sentiment,&mdash;and illimitable in resource
as he was, he generally so managed matters
that we should live well.</p>

<p>We would buy a pig or a lamb, and have a
fore quarter for dinner. The next day Curry
would give us a hind quarter. The next day
another fore quarter; and so on until that member<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
of the mess who had a statistical mind
would begin to reflect that there are really only
four quarters to an animal, while we had had
from fifteen to twenty quarters from this one.
Then Curry would be summoned, and indignantly
asked: &#8220;Where have you been getting
all this meat we have been eating?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question never disturbed Curry in the
least. He was always ready with the answer:
&#8220;I buyed it from one man, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>When asked who the man was, he never
knew. And when questioned as to payment, he
always assured us that the &#8220;one man, sir,&#8221; was
coming that afternoon for his money.</p>

<p>The &#8220;one man, sir,&#8221; always came that afternoon.
His charge was always the same: $2.50
in Confederate currency, or something less than
twenty-five cents in real money.</p>

<p>The pretence was a bit flimsy, but it answered
Curry&#8217;s purpose. His mess was well
fed, and he was not caught in his raids upon the
pig-pens and sheep-folds thereabouts.</p>

<p>Curry was a slave, and we hired him from the
estate to which he belonged as a chattel. One
day we were ordered to move from South
Carolina to Virginia. Curry came to us and
asked to be taken with us. When we explained
to him that we could not legally take him out of
the state, he deliberately proposed to run away
in order to go with us. Having no alert perception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
of the difference between crime and
good conduct, he could not see why we should
not abet him in this proposed violation of law.
But when we made it clear to him that, for
reasons inscrutable to his mind, we could not
permit him to go with us out of the state, he
fell into melancholy.</p>

<p>That night we had some roast pig for dinner;
and Curry had not &#8220;buyed it from one man,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The only reply he would make to our questionings
was: &#8220;I done got it fur de mess, sir.
De mess has been good to me.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Early next morning&mdash;the day on which we
were to leave&mdash;the enemy landed below, and we
were ordered forward to meet them. As we unlimbered
in battery and opened fire, Curry rode
up on an antique mule, stolen for the occasion
from the battery blacksmith. Leaping from his
steed he went to the gun that was most short-handed,
took a vacant place, and began fighting
like an artilleryman. When the head of the
mess rode up to him and said: &#8220;What are you
doing here, Curry?&#8221;</p>

<p>His reply was: &#8220;Ise takin&#8217; a hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fight was hot for ten minutes. At the
end of it poor Curry lay stretched upon the
grass&mdash;a bullet through his chest. One of us
went to him and said something&mdash;no matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
what. He looked up and said: &#8220;I can&#8217;t go wi&#8217;
de mess to Virginy. You&#8217;ll have to take some
no &#8217;count nigger. But Ise fought wi&#8217; de mess
anyhow, and you&#8217;ll find de res&#8217; o&#8217; dat pig hangin&#8217;

<h2 class="nobreak">GUN-BOATS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">A GUN-BOAT went aground one night in
an inlet off Chisholm&#8217;s Island, near Port
Royal, South Carolina.</p>

<p>As soon as the news came to us, we set out
to attack her.</p>

<p>We marched all night, and in the early gray
of the dawn we reached the palmetto-studded
island. The gun-boat had, in the meantime, got
off the bar on the high tide, and was riding
quietly at anchor, four hundred yards from the
nearest available point on the shore.</p>

<p>I had command of two field pieces. Captain
Elliot, the chief of artillery, ordered me to inspect
the vessel and &#8220;act according to circumstances.&#8221;
He said: &#8220;If you find her too strong
to be attacked with field guns, retire quietly
across the island. If you find her not too strong,
attack her, and I will send you any reinforcements
necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took Joe with me.</p>

<p>We crawled up to the brink of the stream, and
took a good look in the gray morning light.</p>

<p>But that look didn&#8217;t tell either of us anything.
Neither of us knew enough about naval architecture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
and armament to have the slightest idea
whether the boat out there in the stream was
formidable or otherwise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think, Joe?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
anything about it; but my notion is that we&#8217;d
better give her a shot or two, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the way I look at it,&#8221; said I, &#8220;is this:
Elliot and those other fellows know, and we
don&#8217;t. They&#8217;ll see her from some point of view.
If they think her not formidable, and we don&#8217;t
attack, they&#8217;ll blame us. If we attack, and she
proves too formidable&mdash;well, we&#8217;ve got good
horses and we can run. Order up the guns,
Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>A minute later we opened fire with two twelve
pounders. By one of those freaks of extraordinarily
good luck, which so often save men from
disaster in war, our first shot severed the gun-boat&#8217;s
rudder post. Our second shell passed
through her boiler and exploded in her furnace;
not only setting fire to her, but with the escaping
steam driving the men from the gun decks.
This left her with only one available gun&mdash;a
swivel on the poop.</p>

<p>But that was a sixty-four pound howitzer, one
or two shots from which would have swept us
off that island like so much dust. Our good
luck continuing, however, that gun burst at the
first fire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>The ship had been a formidable, heavily
armed gun-boat, carrying several eight-inch
rifles; but she had been destroyed by two field
pop-guns. She slipped her cables, and drifted
around the point with fire bursting from every
port hole. We quickly limbered up and galloped
to another point of attack.</p>

<p>We found the ship&#8217;s company escaping over
the sides in the boats and rowing for the marsh
beyond. We opened upon them at short range,
sank several of the boats, and then shelled the
marsh for scatterers.</p>

<p>When I learned later from Captain Elliot how
formidable that ship had been, I was filled with
a great contempt for gun-boats. I was anxious
to get a chance at a gun-boat every morning
before breakfast.</p>

<p>I got it presently. With that same section
I was ordered a few days later to Combahee
Ferry. There was a gun-boat there. My orders
were the same as before.</p>

<p>This gun-boat was a little, low, insignificant
looking sloop. She seemed to me almost contemptibly
easy game. I galloped my guns to
within four hundred yards of her, and ordered
them in battery.</p>

<p>We opened fire. The gun-boat for a time
paid no attention to us. But by the time that
we had thrown three or four shells at her, she
lazily undertook to attend to our case, in much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
the same way that a man brushes a pestilent
fly from his nose.</p>

<p>She opened on us with one of those great
guns which pitch shells about the size of a
normal nail keg two or three miles, apparently
without effort.</p>

<p>Her first shot revealed to me the fact that I
had entirely misunderstood gun-boats.</p>

<p>It was obvious that a single one of those
shells, should it burst anywhere in the neighborhood
of my guns, would put a final end to that
section of artillery and to all that went to constitute
it.</p>

<p>During the next five minutes we bumped
those guns at a gallop over the old cotton rows,
until we reached the cover of the woodland.</p>

<p>Whether that little sloop carried one gun or
twenty, I never knew. But the rapidity of her
fire, as we crossed that old cotton field, convinced
me, for the time being, that she carried
at least a hundred.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TWO MINUTES</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HE spent the evening singing &#8220;Lorena.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had had a sort of day-off that day,
and had visited all of his friends.</p>

<p>The author of that song had made it read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;A hundred weeks have passed, Lorena,&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>but our guest improved upon that, and made
the lover rather aged by singing it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;A hundred <i>years</i> have passed, Lorena,</div>
<div class="verse">Since last I held thy hand in mine.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>This was the only positive evidence we had
that he had been calling.</p>

<p>He stayed with us that night, and was not feeling
well enough the next day even to sing
&#8220;Lorena.&#8221; The next day after that he found
some serious work to do.</p>

<p>The way of it was this: He was a third lieutenant
in the engineers. It was after the great
mine explosion at Petersburg, and the engineers
were busily engaged at that time using all their
devices for the discovery of other mines. They
had found one in process of construction in
front of General Grade&#8217;s lines. They had proceeded
at once to run a deeper tunnel under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
this one. They had loaded the end of it, just
underneath the enemy&#8217;s works, with an incredible
amount of gunpowder, and on that morning
it was to be fired.</p>

<p>A slow-match had been brought from the
powder to the mouth of the mine. It was
lighted, and a period of waiting ensued. The
match had evidently gone out. Where, nobody
knew or could guess. The general in command
of that part of the line turned to the captain of
engineers and said: &#8220;The mine must be blown
up at once; will you go in and light the match
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain hesitated, saying: &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know; it may go off at any moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon he who had sung &#8220;Lorena&#8221;
stepped forward, touched his cap to the general,
and said: &#8220;With your permission, <i>I</i> will go in
and fire it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the general; &#8220;go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man picked up the torch and started
into the mine. It seems that the slow-match
had gone out within a very short distance of
the powder magazine. But disregarding that
he touched the torch to it, set it off again, and
ran with all his might for the mouth of the
opening.</p>

<p>It was two minutes&#8217; work. The mine went
off just before he reached the outlet, and the
air pressure literally blew him out of it. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
fell sprawling on his face. He was considerably
bruised and scratched in his contact with
the gravelly ground, but he was not in any
serious way injured. Picking himself up,
grimed as he was, he took off his cap, and dusting
himself like a schoolboy who has fallen in
the street, he approached the commanding
officer and said: &#8220;General, I have the honor
to report that I have fired the mine and that it
has gone off.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general touched his cap and replied: &#8220;I
had observed that fact, and I thank you very
much. I beg to say that I will make an official
report of the circumstance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two days later we all touched our caps to a
freshly made brigadier-general of the engineers.
The captain who had hesitated remained a
captain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SI TUCKER&mdash;COWARD AND
HERO</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;WAS in command of Fort Lamkin, a mortar
fort, in rear of General Bushrod Johnson&#8217;s
lines at Petersburg in 1864.</p>

<p>The fort was named for our immediate commander,
from whose command we had been
detached for this service.</p>

<p>One day Lamkin himself came to me when I
was at his headquarters. He was obviously in
trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;This boy, Si Tucker,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is the son
of one of the best friends I ever had in the
world. The boy is a coward. He literally <i>lives</i>
in a rat hole. I have repeatedly pulled him
out by the legs, only to have him crawl back
again the moment I let go of his ankles. I
don&#8217;t know what to do. It&#8217;s my duty, of course,
to prefer charges of cowardice against him;
and if I do, he will certainly be shot&mdash;and
his father is my best friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused meditatively, and then said with
eagerness in his voice: &#8220;Why can&#8217;t you take
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>I agreed at once. I told him I would take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
the boy with me to my pits, and make &#8220;either a
soldier or a stiff&#8221; out of him within the next
twenty-four hours. I was under no obligations
to his father; I had never even met any of his
relatives, and I had seen too many years of
service to have much patience with cowardice.</p>

<p>The boy was sent for and ordered to go with
me. We walked down towards Blandford church.
At the proper point we turned out of the Jerusalem
plank road across the fields towards Fort
Lamkin. Half-way there and on the top of a
little hill, which was especially exposed to the
gaze of the sharp-shooters, I made Si Tucker
sit down by my side. There we came to an
understanding.</p>

<p>I told him that he had been assigned to me
to be shot out of hand, or to be court-martialled
for cowardice, which at that particular juncture
of the war meant very much the same
thing. I explained to him that he was about
to join a detachment, composed exclusively of
men specially selected for their courage&mdash;every
one of them a volunteer for what was deemed a
peculiarly dangerous service.</p>

<p>I explained further that I should require him
to do his duty as they did theirs.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have managed to make for yourself,&#8221;
I said, &#8220;the reputation of a coward. You have
now one last chance to redeem yourself. You
must do that, or you must die.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>The sharp-shooters were, in the meantime,
picking at us most uncomfortably as we sat
there. My experience as an old soldier strongly
suggested to me that we ought to move. The
position was of that kind that military men
call untenable. Nevertheless, I thought it best
to keep Si Tucker there a minute longer, for
purposes of observation, if nothing else.</p>

<p>&#8220;At our pits,&#8221; I said, &#8220;we have one uniform
rule of procedure. When a bombardment begins,
the men go to their guns. I take my
stand on top of the magazine mound to watch
the enemy&#8217;s fire and direct our own. If I see
that a mortar shell is about to fall into one of
the gun pits, I call out the pit number, and the
men run into the bomb-proof until the explosion
is over. No man ever goes into a bomb-proof
till this order is given. You must do as the rest
do. If you run to a bomb-proof before I have
given the order, it will be my imperative duty
to shoot you then and there; and I shall certainly
discharge that duty. Do you fully understand
that, Si?&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought he did, and as the sharp-shooters
were by this time becoming pestilently personal
in their attentions, we resumed our walk.</p>

<p>Half an hour after our arrival at Fort Lamkin,
a bombardment began.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t want to shoot that boy. I distinctly
preferred to make a soldier rather than a &#8220;stiff&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
out of him. So, instead of taking my customary
stand on the mound of earth over the magazine,
I ordered Joe to that post, and placed myself
in the gun pit to which Si Tucker had been
assigned, taking care to stand between him and
the mouth of the bomb-proof. I spoke to him
as I passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember what I told you. If you forget,
it is instant death.&#8221;</p>

<p>He remembered. For nearly two hours he
stood there quaking and quivering, but not daring
to seek safety by retreat to a bomb-proof.</p>

<p>By the time that the outburst was over, Si
Tucker had learned his first lesson in war. He
had learned to realize that a man may endure
a lot of very savage fire, and yet come out of it
alive.</p>

<p>A few hours later, when the guns were at
work again, Si was steady enough in his nerves
to carry shells to the guns. The next day he
was even able during a bombardment to cut
fuses&mdash;a delicate operation requiring a steady
hand.</p>

<p>Within two or three days he had become as
good a soldier as we had in all that band of men
specially picked for their unflinching courage.</p>

<p>When the great mine explosion occurred a
few weeks later, I had occasion to rebuke Si
Tucker for a fault quite unrelated to cowardice.
We had been ordered to go with our mortars as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
near as possible to the crater, and to drop a continual
rain of shells among the thousands of
helpless fellows in that awful pit.</p>

<p>It was cruel, ghastly work. But it was war.
And a poet has justly characterized war as a
&#8220;brain-spattering, windpipe-slitting art.&#8221; Or as
General Sherman once said,&mdash;and he knew,&mdash;&#8220;War
is all hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were within sixty yards of the crater.
Each one of our mortars was belching from three
to five shells a minute into that hole; but Si
Tucker&#8217;s enthusiasm was not satisfied. Having
no personal duty to do at the moment, he began
plugging shells with long fuses, lighting them,
running with them to the margin of the pit, and
tossing them in as hand grenades. He was
greeted by a tremendous volley of musketry at
each repetition of this performance, but he did
it three times before we could stop him.</p>

<p>That evening, near the gloaming, he did another
thing. The lines had by that time been
restored. The men in the crater&mdash;those of
them who had not been killed&mdash;had been driven
back to the Federal side. We became aware of
the fact that a poor fellow of our own was lying
grievously wounded near the Federal side of the
fifty yards that separated our works from the
enemy&#8217;s. He had been lying there through all
that long, fierce summer day. The explosion at
daylight had cast him there.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>His groans and his cries for help and for
water were piteous in the extreme. We listened
to them heartbroken but helpless&mdash;all but Si
Tucker.</p>

<p>Si began stripping off his clothes; we thought
he had gone mad. But when we asked him why
he was stripping himself, he replied: &#8220;Never
you mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that, stripped to the skin, he leaped
over the works, ducked his head low, and ran
through that hailstorm of bullets to where the
wounded man lay. Grasping him quickly, he
slung him upon his back like a bag of meal, and
ran back with all his might.</p>

<p>As he crossed the works he fell headlong.</p>

<p>The surgeon found three bullets in his body.</p>

<p>Nobody in the battery ever remembered after
that, that Si Tucker had once been a coward.</p>

<p>After all, it is perhaps mainly a question of
nerves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">WAR AS A THERAPEUTIC
AGENT</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">DOCTOR TOWNS was a wealthy gentleman
in Mississippi.</p>

<p>For a good many years he had employed
Miss R&mdash;&mdash; of Massachusetts as governess for
his daughters. She had lived all these years as
an honored member of his family, with every
social opportunity that Mississippi society afforded.</p>

<p>At last the two girls outgrew the need of a
governess. One of them was sent abroad to
study art at Nuremberg. The other got married.</p>

<p>Upon the occurrence of this event Doctor
Towns went to the young lady, Miss R&mdash;&mdash;,
and suggested that as her services had been
of incalculable value to his daughters he was
anxious to secure for her, now that they no
longer needed her, an equally good situation in
some other gentleman&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>He explained that he had already written to
a friend in Alabama strongly recommending
her, and that his friend desired her to come on
at once.</p>

<p>Apparently this pleased Miss R&mdash;&mdash; very
greatly. She packed her trunks that night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
with the aid of the colored maid who had been
assigned to her service. She was to leave in
the morning.</p>

<p>In the morning word came down from her
chamber that she was unable to get up. Every
attention and every sympathy was shown her,
and after a day or two Doctor Towns, finding
himself baffled to discover disease of any kind,
sent for another physician. The other physician
was equally unsuccessful. The simple
fact was that the young woman could not get
out of her bed. Why she could not get out of
her bed was a problem that the medical men
were wholly unable to solve. The young
woman&#8217;s appetite was excellent, and all her
functions seemed to be in an entirely normal
condition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she could not get up.</p>

<p>Week after week she lay there, attentively
waited upon by the servants, assiduously visited
by the family, sympathetically condoled with by
friends, but still utterly unable to arise from her
bed. Her salary was continued all the while,
of course.</p>

<p>The servants at last became suspicious.</p>

<p>To their minds it seemed incredible that she
should live so long and so comfortably without
exercise. They suspected that she got up in
the night and walked the floor. To test this
they gently sprinkled her floor with pulverized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
starch while she slept, and then turned out the
lights. But weeks of experimentation of this
character utterly failed to reveal that the young
woman ever got out of her bed.</p>

<p>She read the newspapers with great diligence
every day, and she read all the new books that
came out, for they all came to Doctor Towns&#8217;s
household.</p>

<p>She even wrote now and then, lying there in
bed, for newspapers and magazines with which
she had established connections. She was a
brilliant woman, and her matter was acceptable
in the market.</p>

<p>She lay thus, for eighteen months. Then
came secession.</p>

<p>The newspapers were filled with it. When
at last war became an obvious fact, and escape
from the South to any Northern person disinclined
to Southern policies was manifestly a
matter of but a few days, Miss R&mdash;&mdash; suddenly,
I may almost say miraculously, recovered. She
got up one morning and packed her trunks
before six o&#8217;clock. At seven, when the family
breakfast was served, she appeared in the dining-room,
and calmly asked: &#8220;Will you kindly
send me to the railroad station, Doctor Towns?
I&#8217;m going North to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>No explanation was ever asked or ever given.</p>

<p>Miss R&mdash;&mdash; went North. That was all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">&#8220;NOTES ON COLD HARBOR&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor"><small>[1]</small></a></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;ALWAYS think of our arrival at Cold Harbor
as marking a new phase of the war.</p>

<p>By the time that we had reached that position,
we had pretty well got over our astonishment
and disappointment at the conduct of
General Grant.</p>

<p>I put the matter in that way because, as I remember,
astonishment and disappointment were
the prevailing emotions in the ranks of the army
of Northern Virginia when we discovered, after
the contest in the Wilderness, that General Grant
was not going to retire behind the river and permit
General Lee to carry on a campaign against
Washington in the usual way, but was moving
to the Spottsylvania position instead.</p>

<p>We had been accustomed to a program which
began with a Federal advance, culminated in
one great battle, and ended in the retirement
of the Union army, the substitution of a new
Federal commander for the one beaten, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
institution of a more or less offensive campaign
on our part.</p>

<p>This was the usual order of events, and this
was what we confidently expected when General
Grant crossed into the Wilderness. But
here was a new Federal general, fresh from the
West, and so ill informed as to the military customs
in our part of the country, that when the
battle of the Wilderness was over, instead of
retiring to the north bank of the river, and
awaiting the development of Lee&#8217;s plans, he
had the temerity to move by his left flank to a
new position, there to try conclusions with us
again.</p>

<p>We were greatly disappointed with General
Grant, and full of curiosity to know how long it
was going to take him to perceive the impropriety
of his course.</p>

<p>But by the time that we reached Cold Harbor,
we had begun to understand what our
new adversary meant, and there, for the first
time I think, the men in the ranks of the army
of Northern Virginia realized that the era of
experimental campaigns against us was over;
that Grant was not going to retreat; that he
was not to be removed from command because
he had failed to break Lee&#8217;s resistance; and
that the policy of pounding had begun, and
would continue until our strength should be
utterly worn away, unless by some decisive blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
to the army in our front, or some brilliant movement
in diversion,&mdash;such as Early&#8217;s invasion of
Maryland a little later was intended to be,&mdash;we
should succeed in changing the character of the
contest.</p>

<p>We began to understand that Grant had taken
hold of the problem of destroying the Confederate
strength in the only way that the strength
of such an army, so commanded, could be
destroyed, and that he intended to continue the
plodding work till the task should be accomplished,
wasting very little time or strength in
efforts to make a brilliant display of generalship
in a contest of strategic wits with Lee. We
at last began to understand what Grant had
meant by his expression of a determination to
&#8220;fight it out on this line, if it takes all summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our state of mind, however, was curiously illustrative
of the character of the contest, and of
the people who participated in it on the part of
the South. The Southern folk were always
debaters, loving logic, and taking off their hats
to a syllogism.</p>

<p>They had never been able to understand how
any reasonable mind could doubt the right of
secession, or fail to see the unlawfulness and
iniquity of coercion, and they were in a chronic
state of astonished incredulity, as the war began,
that the North could indeed be about to wage a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
war that was manifestly forbidden by unimpeachable
logic.</p>

<p>In the same way, at Cold Harbor, we were all
disposed to waste a good deal of intellectual
energy in demonstrating to each other the
absurd and unreasonable character of General
Grant&#8217;s procedure. We could show that he
must have lost already in that campaign more
men than Lee&#8217;s entire force, and ought, logically,
to acknowledge his defeat and retire; that
having begun the contest with an overwhelming
advantage in point of numbers, he ought to be
ashamed to ask for reinforcements; and that
while continuing the process of suffering great
losses, in order to inflict much smaller losses on
us, he could ultimately wear us out, it was inconceivable
that any general should consent to win
in that unfair way.</p>

<p>In like manner we were prepared to prove
the wicked imbecility of his plan of campaign&mdash;a
plan that could only end by placing him in
a position below Richmond and Petersburg,
which he might just as well reach by an
advance from Fort Monroe, without the tremendous
slaughter of the Wilderness, Spottsylvania,
etc.</p>

<p>In view of General Grant&#8217;s stolid indifference
to considerations of this character, however,
there was nothing for us to do but fight the
matter out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>We had no fear of the ultimate result, however
plainly our own perception of facts pointed
to the inevitable destruction of our power of
resistance. We had absolute faith in Lee&#8217;s
ability to meet and repel any assault that might
be made, and to devise some means of destroying
Grant. There was, therefore, no fear in the
Confederate ranks of anything that General
Grant might do; but there was an appalling
and well-founded fear of starvation, which indeed
some of us were already suffering. From
the beginning of that campaign our food-supply
had been barely sufficient to maintain life, and
on the march from Spottsylvania to Cold Harbor
it would have been a gross exaggeration to describe
it in that way.</p>

<p>In my own battery, three hard biscuits and
one very meagre slice of fat pork were issued
to each man on our arrival, and that was the
first food that any of us had seen since our
departure from Spottsylvania, two days before.
The next supply did not come till two days
later, and it consisted of a single cracker per
man, with no meat at all.</p>

<p>We practised a very rigid economy with this
food, of course. We ate the pork raw, partly
because there was no convenient means of cooking
it, but more because cooking would have
involved some waste. We hoarded what we
had, allowing ourselves only a nibble at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
one time, and that only when the pangs of hunger
became unbearable.</p>

<p>But what is the use of writing about the
pangs of hunger? The words are utterly meaningless
to persons who have never known actual
starvation, and they cannot be made other than
meaningless. Hunger to starving men is wholly
unrelated to the desire for food as that is commonly
understood and felt. It is a great agony
of the whole body and soul as well. It is an unimaginable,
all-pervading pain, inflicted when
the strength to endure pain is utterly gone. It
is the great, despairing cry of a wasting body&mdash;a
cry of flesh and blood, marrow, nerves, bones,
and faculties for strength with which to exist
and to endure existence. It is a horror which,
once suffered, leaves an impression that is never
erased from the memory, and to this day the
agony of that campaign comes back upon me
at the mere thought of any living creature&#8217;s
lacking the food it desires, even though its
hunger be only the ordinary craving, and the
denial be necessary for the creature&#8217;s health.</p>

<p>When we reached Cold Harbor, the command
to which I belonged had been marching almost
continuously day and night for more than fifty
hours without food; and, for the first time, we
knew what actual starvation was. It was during
that march that I heard a man wish himself
a woman,&mdash;the only case of the kind I ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
heard of,&mdash;and he uttered the wish half in grim
jest, and made haste to qualify it by adding
&#8220;or a baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet we recovered our cheerfulness at once
after taking the first nibble of the crackers issued
to us there, and made a jest of the scantiness
of the supply. One tall, lean mountaineer,
Jim Thomas by name, who received a slight
wound every time he was under fire, and was
never sufficiently hurt to quit duty, was standing
on a bank of earth slowly munching a bit
of his last cracker and watching the effect of
some artillery fire which was in progress at the
time, when a bullet carried away his cap and
cut a strip of hair from his head, leaving the
scalp for a space as bald as if it had been
shaved with a razor. He sat down at once to
nurse a sharp headache, and then discovered
that the cracker he had held in his hand was
gone, leaving a mere fragment in his grasp.
At first he was in doubt whether he might not
have eaten it unconsciously; but he quickly
discovered that it had been knocked out of his
hand and crushed to bits by a bullet, whereupon
as he sat there in an exposed place, where
the fire was unobstructed, he lamented his loss
in soliloquy.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had eaten that cracker half an hour
ago, it would have been safe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
should have had none left for next time, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
have none left as it is. That shows how foolish
it is to save anything. Whew! how my head
aches. I wish it was from overeating, but even
the doctor couldn&#8217;t lay it to that just now. The
next time I stand up to watch the firing, I&#8217;ll put
my cracker&mdash;if I have any&mdash;in a safe place
down by the breastworks, where it won&#8217;t get
wounded, poor thing! By the way, here&#8217;s a
little piece left, and that&#8217;ll get shot while I sit
here talking.&#8221; And with that he jumped down
into the ditch, carefully placed the mouthful of
hardtack at the foot of the works, and resumed
his interested observation of the artillery duel.</p>

<p>Trifling of that kind was constant among the
men throughout that terrible campaign from the
Wilderness to Petersburg, and while it yielded
nothing worth recording as wit or humor, it has
always seemed to me the most remarkable and
most significant fact in the history of the time.
It revealed a capacity for cheerful endurance
which alone made the campaign possible on the
Confederate side.</p>

<p>With mercenary troops or regulars the resistance
that Lee was able to offer to Grant&#8217;s tremendous
pressure would have been impossible
in such circumstances. The starvation and the
excessive marching would have destroyed the
morale of troops held together only by discipline.
No historical criticism of our Civil War
can be otherwise than misleading if it omits to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
give a prominent place, as a factor, to the character
of the volunteers on both sides, who, in
acquiring the steadiness and order of regulars,
never lost their personal interest in the contest,
or their personal pride of manhood as a sustaining
force under trying conditions. If either
side had lacked this element of personal heroism
on the part of its men, it would have been
driven from the field long before 1865. It seems
to me the most important duty of those who now
furnish the materials out of which the ultimate
history of our Civil War will be constructed to
emphasize this aspect of the matter, and in every
possible way to illustrate the part which the high
personal character of the volunteers in the ranks
played in determining the events of the contest.
For that reason I like to record one incident
which I had an opportunity to observe at Cold
Harbor.</p>

<p>Immediately opposite the position occupied
by the battery to which I belonged, and about
six or eight hundred yards distant across an
open field, lay a Federal battery, whose commander
was manifestly a man deeply in earnest
for other and higher reasons than those that
govern the professional soldier: a man who
fought well, because he fought in what he felt
to be his own cause and quarrel.</p>

<p>His guns and ours were engaged almost continuously
in an artillery duel, so that I became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
especially interested in him, particularly as the
extreme precision of his fire indicated thoroughness
and conscientiousness of work for months
before the campaign began. One day&mdash;whether
before or after the great assault, I cannot now
remember&mdash;that part of our line which lay
immediately to the left of the position occupied
by the battery to which I belonged was thrown
forward to force the opposing Federal line back.
It was the only large movement in the way of
a charge over perfectly open ground that I ever
had a chance to observe with an unobstructed
view, and merely as a spectator.</p>

<p>When we, with a few well-aimed shells, had
fired a barn that stood between the lines, and
driven a multitude of sharp-shooters out of it,
the troops to our left leaped over our works
and with a cheer moved rapidly across the field.
The resistance made to their advance was not
very determined,&mdash;probably the Federal line at
that point had been weakened by concentration
elsewhere,&mdash;and after a brief struggle our men
crossed the slight Federal earthworks and pressed
their adversaries back into the woods and beyond
my view. It was a beautiful operation to look
at, and one, the like of which, a soldier rarely
has an opportunity to see so well; but my attention
was specially drawn to the situation of
the artillery commander, to whom I have referred
as posted immediately in our front. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
position was the pivot, the point where the
Federal line was broken to a new angle, when
that part of it which lay upon his right hand
was pressed back while that on his left remained
stationary.</p>

<p>He fought like a Turk or a tiger.</p>

<p>He directed the greater part of his fire upon
the advancing line of Confederates, but turned
a gun every few minutes upon our battery,
apparently by way of letting us know that he
was not unmindful of our attentions, even when
he was so busily engaged elsewhere.</p>

<p>The bending back of the line on his right
presently subjected him to a murderous fire
upon the flank and rear,&mdash;a fire against which
he had no protection whatever,&mdash;while we continued
a furious bombardment from the front.
His position was plainly an untenable one, and
so far as I could discover with a strong glass, he
was for a time without infantry support. But
he held his ground and continued to fight in
spite of all, firing at one time as from two faces
of an acute triangle.</p>

<p>His determination was superb, and the coolness
of his gunners and cannoneers was worthy
of the unbounded admiration which we, their
enemies, felt for them. Their firing increased
as their difficulties multiplied, but it showed no
sign of becoming wild or hurried. Every shot
went straight to the object against which it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
directed; every fuse was accurately timed, and
every shell burst where it was intended to burst.
I remember that in the very heat of the contest
there came into my mind Bulwer&#8217;s superb description
of Warwick&#8217;s last struggle, in which
he says that around the king-maker&#8217;s person
there &#8220;centred a little WAR,&#8221; and I applied
the phrase to the heroic fellow who was so
superbly fighting against hopeless odds immediately
in front of me.</p>

<p>Several of his guns were dismounted and his
dead horses were strewn in the rear. The loss
among his men was appalling, but he fought on
as coolly as before, and with our glasses we could
see him calmly sitting on his large gray horse
directing his gunners and patiently awaiting the
coming of the infantry support, without which
he could not withdraw his guns. It came at last,
and the batteries retired to the new line.</p>

<p>When the battalion was gone and the brief
action over, the wreck that was left behind bore
sufficient witness of the fearfulness of the fire
so coolly endured. The large gray horse lay
dead upon the ground; but we preferred to believe
that his brave rider was still alive to receive
the promotion which he had so well won.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A PLANTATION HEROINE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was nearing the end.</p>

<p>Every resource of the Southern states had
been taxed to the point of exhaustion.</p>

<p>The people had given up everything they
had for &#8220;the cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the law of a &#8220;tax in kind,&#8221; they had
surrendered all they could spare of food products
of every character. Under an untamable
impulse of patriotism they had surrendered
much more than they could spare in order to
feed the army.</p>

<p>It was at such a time that I went to my home
county on a little military business. I stopped
for dinner at a house, the lavish hospitality of
which had been a byword in the old days.</p>

<p>I found before me at dinner the remnants of
a cold boiled ham, some boiled mustard greens,
which we Virginians called &#8220;salad,&#8221; a pitcher
of butter-milk, some corn-pones and&mdash;nothing
else.</p>

<p>I carved the ham, and offered to serve it to
the three women of the household. But they
all declined. They made their dinner on
salad, butter-milk, and corn-bread, the latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
eaten very sparingly, as I observed. The ham
went only to myself and to the three convalescent
wounded soldiers, who were guests in the
house.</p>

<p>Wounded men were at that time guests in
every house in Virginia.</p>

<p>I lay awake that night and thought over the
circumstance. The next morning I took occasion
to have a talk on the old familiar terms
with the young woman of the family, with
whom I had been on a basis of friendship in
the old days that even permitted me to kiss her
upon due and proper occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you take some ham last night?&#8221;
I asked urgently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t want it,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you know you&#8217;re fibbing,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Tell me the truth, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She blushed, and hesitated. Presently she
broke down and answered frankly: &#8220;Honestly,
I did want the ham. I have hungered for meat
for months. But I mustn&#8217;t eat it, and I won&#8217;t.
You see the army needs all the food there is,
and more. We women can&#8217;t fight, though
I don&#8217;t see at all why they shouldn&#8217;t let us,
and so we are trying to feed the fighting men&mdash;and
there aren&#8217;t any others. We&#8217;ve made up
our minds not to eat anything that can be sent
to the front as rations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are starving yourselves,&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And if we were, what
would it matter? Haven&#8217;t Lee&#8217;s soldiers starved
many a day? But we aren&#8217;t starving. You
see we had plenty of salad and butter-milk last
night. And we even ate some of the corn-bread.
I must stop that, by the way, for corn-meal
is a good ration for the soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>A month or so later this frail but heroic
young girl was laid away in the Grub Hill
church-yard.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t talk to me about the &#8220;heroism&#8221; that
braves a fire of hell under enthusiastic impulse.
That young girl did a higher act of self-sacrifice
than any soldier who fought on either side during
the war ever dreamed of doing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TWO INCIDENTS IN CONTRAST</h2>
</div>


<h3>INCIDENT NUMBER ONE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Masters place at Amelia Court House
was a dream of beauty. Major Masters
himself was a man of exquisite taste, and his
wife and daughter had been devoted for years
to the creation of beauty there.</p>

<p>They had had the expert aid of Thomas
Giles. Thomas Giles was a lawyer by profession,
but being a man of large wealth, and having
nobody dependent upon him, he had devoted
a considerable share of his attention for years
to his two fancies&mdash;architecture and landscape
gardening.</p>

<p>It had been his long-continued custom to
spend his time from Friday afternoon till Monday
of each week at the Masters place, developing
its possibilities of beauty. He had spent
both his own money and that of Major Masters
very lavishly in this endeavor, and the result
was a notable one.</p>

<p>When the Federal army reached the court
house in hot pursuit of General Lee, during
that last retreat which ended the war, there
was a rush made by the soldiers for comfortable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
camping grounds on the Masters place. One
man had even begun to cut down a stately tree
for firewood, when the general commanding
rode up. Taking in the situation at a glance,
the general turned to one of his aids and said:
&#8220;Take a squad of twenty men, and drive everybody
out of that place quick. Then tell the
adjutant-general to post a close guard around
it and allow no man to enter it during our stay,
upon any pretence whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, turning to his staff as the officer rode
away to execute his orders, he said: &#8220;That
place has cost years of growth as well as years
of intelligent endeavor to create it. As we are
not vandals, I shall not suffer it to be destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>I regret that I cannot here record the name
of that officer. I would if I knew it.</p>


<h3>INCIDENT NUMBER TWO</h3>

<p>At McPhersonville, on the coast of South
Carolina, there lived a young woman of extraordinary
learning.</p>

<p>The fame of her learning, especially in botany,
had even crossed the ocean; and it was
she whom Baron Von Humboldt had selected
to prepare for him&mdash;for use in his writings&mdash;an
account of the flora of that region.</p>

<p>In recognition of her scholarly service, Baron
Von Humboldt had sent to her&mdash;each volume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
inscribed with his own hand&mdash;the only copy
ever owned in the United States of the German
government&#8217;s magnificent &eacute;dition de luxe
of &#8220;Cosmos.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a work published without regard to
expense, and in narrowly limited edition, at a
fabulous price per copy.</p>

<p>When the final collapse came, and Sherman&#8217;s
army was sweeping northward from Savannah,
a detachment under the command of a lieutenant
visited the house of this young woman.
Building a bonfire in the front yard, it proceeded
to destroy all the food that it could
find. Then, in a spirit of pure vandalism, the
lieutenant ordered his men to bring out and
burn the books in that superb library. The
young woman was in tears and terror, of course,
but her scholarly impulses rose superior to her
timid, feminine instincts. She went up to the
lieutenant, coarse brute that he was, and begged
for the preservation of her unique &#8220;Cosmos.&#8221;</p>

<p>She explained to him what it was and how
much it meant to scholarship. She begged him
to take it with him and present it to Yale, or
Harvard, or Princeton, or to the Astor library,
or to any other institution of learning to which
it might become a possession of glory.</p>

<p><i>He slapped her in the face, and with his own
hands threw the precious volumes into the
fire.</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>A nation at war must select its human instruments
with regard to their capacity for fighting,
and with very little regard to anything
else. Whether the officer be a gentleman or
a blackguard is a matter that counts for little
so long as he knows how to fight.</p>

<p>But I regret that I cannot here record the
name of <i>this</i> officer also.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW THE SERGEANT-MAJOR
TOLD THE TRUTH</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SO far as I know, the sergeant-major never
told a lie in his life; but he came very
near it that night at Grahamville.</p>

<p>Grahamville is a village on the Charleston
and Savannah railroad, and this was in 1862,
when the enemy held the sea islands along
that coast. Whenever they landed and advanced
toward the railroad, it was our business
to march down and meet them at such points
of vantage as the marshes and causeways
afforded.</p>

<p>The battery had been stationed at Grahamville
about two months, and, as the enemy had
been inactive all that time, there was nothing
whatever to do; nothing, that is to say, except
to practise with pistols on the bullet-proof hide
of an antique alligator, which used to lie upon
a log in the swamp in front of us sunning himself
and apparently rather enjoying the impingement
of bullets upon his ribs. We had
pretty well exhausted that amusement; so when
the news came that there was to be a dance
at Tucker&#8217;s,&mdash;about twelve miles in rear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Grahamville,&mdash;the captain, the one lieutenant
on duty, and the surgeon promptly accepted
the invitation. They omitted the formality of
sending to headquarters for leave of absence.
They simply went.</p>

<p>The sergeant-major, who carried on a voluminous
correspondence with various young women
in different parts of the Confederacy, had letters
to write and preferred to remain behind. Besides
that, his boots were broken out on both
sides, and his linen coat&mdash;the only thing he
had that was cool enough for such an occasion
in such a climate&mdash;had only one button on it,
and that one a black one sewed on with white
thread. The sergeant-major rather valued himself
upon his personal pulchritude, and preferred
solitude in the camp to any unfavorable exhibition
of himself and his wardrobe. So the sergeant-major
was left in command of the battery.</p>

<p>It was on that particular night, of course, that
the enemy concluded to make a threatening
landing on the coast below. Hurried orders
came from General Clingman for the battery to
move forward at once. The sergeant-major
received the orders, had the assembly blown,
and promptly moved forward with the guns.
He was a very earnest and conscientious young
man. That is why he came so near telling lies
that night. He was fond of his officers and
very much devoted to their welfare. It would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
have gone hard with them had their absence
become known to the commanding general.</p>

<p>As the sergeant-major rode along in the
murkiness of a cloudy, Southern midnight at
the head of the battery, General Clingman rode
up and asked, &#8220;Where&#8217;s your captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in rear,&#8221; said the sergeant-major.
Now, strictly speaking, this was the exact truth.
The captain was in rear&mdash;twelve or fifteen
miles in rear! Nevertheless the sergeant-major
felt an uncomfortable consciousness that his
words conveyed to the mind of the general an
impression that was not quite accurate. When
the general inquired about the one other officer
supposed to be on duty at that time, the
sergeant-major replied: &#8220;He also is somewhere
in rear at the moment.&#8221; You see the sergeant-major
was getting used to this sort of thing.</p>

<p>The general replied; &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s no matter,
you can take the orders and communicate
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon he gave instructions as to the
disposition of the guns in case of a fight. After
that he rode to the front. It was his habit to
be at the front as his force approached an
enemy.</p>

<p>An hour or two later our returning cavalry
reported that the enemy had returned to his
island camp. Our long night march had gone
for nothing. We were a little bit disappointed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
but as we had marched during all the hours of
darkness, and as the gray was beginning to split
the eastern sky, we were not very reluctant to
turn back towards camp and breakfast.</p>

<p>But when, soon after the return march began,
the sergeant-major saw the general riding up,
he felt a trifle uneasy. You see he was not yet
an artist in prevarication. His life-long habit of
telling the truth sat heavily upon him. Nevertheless,
when the general asked for the captain
and lieutenant, the sergeant-major said, with
as much of nonchalance as he could assume:
&#8220;They&#8217;re somewhere in <i>front</i>, I think, general,&#8221;
and the general rode away satisfied.
When the battery reached camp, the officers
had just returned from the dance at Tuckers.
They were frantic with apprehension and rage
at finding their command gone to fight the
enemy and they not with it. They were
minutely questioning the camp servants as to
the movement. And when the sergeant-major
rode up at the head of the column of guns, they
assailed him with a volley of questions, which,
if they had been shells, would have struck the
enemy off any field: the sergeant-major rather
enjoyed this part of the proceeding.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a time did you have at Tucker&#8217;s?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, confound Tucker&#8217;s!&#8221; answered the
captain. &#8220;Speak, can&#8217;t you, man, and tell us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
about this thing. Did the general ask after us,
and what did you tell him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered the sergeant-major, &#8220;he
did ask, and I told him the truth, but not the
whole truth. My conscience is a little bit
bruised and sore over it, and the next time you
fellows go off to a dance without letting the
general know, I&#8217;m going to tell him the whole
truth. Is there anything to eat?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TWO GENTLEMEN AT PETERSBURG</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AT that point where the great mine was
blown up at Petersburg, the lines of the
two armies were within fifty yards of each
other.</p>

<p>In the fearful slaughter that ensued, the space
between the rival breastworks was literally
piled high with dead men, lying one on top
of the other. Only in one other place, namely,
at Cold Harbor, was there ever so much of
slaughter within so small a space.</p>

<p>It was evident, apart from all considerations
of decency, that for the comfort of both sides
some arrangement must be made for the burial
of these dead men. Neither side could have
lived long in its works otherwise.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a cartel was arranged between
General Grant and General Lee. It was stipulated
that there should be a cessation of hostilities
for a specified number of hours for the
purpose of burying the dead.</p>

<p>It was arranged that two lines should be
formed twelve feet apart in the middle of the
space between the works; that one line should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
be composed of Federal sentinels, the other of
Confederates; that the space between these two
lines should be a neutral ground, accessible to
both sides; but that no person from either side
should cross the line established by the other
side. It was agreed that the dead men who
had fallen within the Confederate line should
be dragged to the neutral ground by Confederate
soldiers, and there delivered to Federal
troops to be carried within their lines for burial.</p>

<p>There were no Confederate dead there, of
course. All of our men who had been killed
were killed within our own works. So every
corpse on our side of the neutral ground was
dragged by a rope to that common space and
there delivered to its official friends.</p>

<p>It was specially stipulated in the cartel that
no officer or soldier on either side should take
advantage of the truce to appropriate property
of any kind lying upon the field, whether upon
the one or the other side of the neutral ground.
Swords, pistols, sashes, everything of the kind
must, by agreement, be left precisely where
they were.</p>

<p>Many of us, of course, went out to the neutral
ground to look over the situation. There was
a certain gruesome delight even in standing
upon ground, where for a month or more it had
been impossible for a twig or a blade of grass
to grow without instant decapitation, and where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
for months to come it would be equally impossible
for anything having material substance to
exist. The very turf itself had been literally
skinned from the surface of the earth by a continuous
scything of bullets. For a month it
had been impossible for any soldier on either
side even to shoot over the breastworks, for he
who tried to do so was sure to be instantly destroyed.
The fire on either side had to be
through carefully sand-bag-guarded port holes.
And even the port holes had to be protected by
hanging blankets behind them to conceal the
sky, lest their darkening by a human head
should invite a hailstorm of alert and waiting
bullets.</p>

<p>Of course every man who, during the truce,
wandered over this perilous space for an hour,
must have been impressed, if he had any imagination
at all, with the historical interest of the
occasion. Every one desired naturally to carry
away some memento of the event. Only one
man yielded to this impulse, and he did so
thoughtlessly. He was a captain of Confederate
infantry.</p>

<p>He saw lying on the ground a star that had
been cut by a bullet from some officer&#8217;s coat
collar.</p>

<p>It was a worthless bauble, valuable only as a
souvenir. He picked it up and pocketed it.
Instantly he was arrested by the Confederate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
guards and taken before the officer in command
of the Confederate line.</p>

<p>That officer immediately and with great dignity
went to the Federal commander and said:
&#8220;I desire under the terms of the cartel to surrender
this officer to you for such punishment
as a court-martial of your army may see fit to
inflict. He has violated the cartel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has he done?&#8221; asked the Federal
officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has taken possession of property left
upon the field, contrary to the terms of the
truce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling me,&#8221; asked the Federal
officer, &#8220;the exact nature and extent of his
offence?&#8221;</p>

<p>A little explanation followed, the Confederate
commander remaining stern and uncompromising
in his determination to deliver the man for
punishment, asking no favors or mercies for
him, and offering no apologies for that which
he deemed a breach of honor.</p>

<p>When the Federal officer had learned the
exact facts of the situation, he made the usual
military salute and said to the Confederate commander:
&#8220;I thank you. You have been very
honorable and very punctilious, but the officer&#8217;s
fault has been merely one of inadvertence. I
beg to return him to you with the assurance
that we have no desire to punish so brave a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
man as he must be, in order to hold his commission
in your army, for an act that involved no
intention of wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here were two brave men&mdash;two gentlemen&mdash;met.
Naturally they understood each other.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OLD JONES AND THE
HUCKSTER</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT is a fixed principle of military law that no
person is allowed to sell supplies within the
lines of a camp without permission of the commandant.</p>

<p>It is also a fixed principle of military law that
he must sell only at prices approved by the
commandant.</p>

<p>I shall never forget how I first learned of
these military rules. We were at Camp Onward
and old Jones had just become our colonel.</p>

<p>One day a farmer came to the camp with a
heavily laden wagon. It was in the summer of
1861, when food in Northern Virginia was
abundant, and when our money was as good as
anybody&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Our farmer had among his supplies, dressed
turkeys, suckling pigs, lamb, mutton, watermelons,
cantaloupes, string beans, Lima beans,
green peas, and in brief almost all those things
that we read about on the bill of fare of a
swagger hotel, kept on the &#8220;American Plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had butter also, and lard. He had eggplants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
and pumpkins, and a great many other
things.</p>

<p>We were a rather hungry lot, and were
strongly inclined to buy of him.</p>

<p>But this farmer had evidently made up his
mind to get comfortably rich off that single
wagon load of provisions. Two years later we
should not have been surprised at his prices, but
at that time we were appalled. Nevertheless,
some of us were buying with the recklessness
of men who do not know at what hour a bullet
may draw a red line below all accounts.</p>

<p>Just then old Jones came out in his yellow
coat and his pot hat, looking greatly more like
a farmer than the wagon man did. Speaking
through his nose, and with that extraordinary
deliberation which always made his conversation
a caricature of human speech, he asked: &#8220;What
are you chargin&#8217; for turkeys? What are you
chargin&#8217; for butter?&#8221; And so on through the
list, receiving a reply to each query, and carefully
noting it in his thoroughly organized mind.</p>

<p>Then he turned to one of the men and said:
&#8220;Send the regimental commissary to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the commissary came he said to him:
&#8220;Take these supplies, and distribute them
equitably among the different messes according
to their numbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the farmer had become alarmed.
He said: &#8220;Who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to pay for all this?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said old Jones. &#8220;In my own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, hold on,&#8221; said the farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I reckon we won&#8217;t hold on,&#8221; said old
Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll send for the colonel of the regiment,&#8221;
said the farmer.</p>

<p>Then old Jones replied with a relish: &#8220;I am
the colonel of this regiment. And I have
ordered these food supplies distributed to the
men in the messes. The regimental commissary
will obey my orders. And as soon as your
wagon is emptied, you will get out of this camp
in a considerable of a hurry,&#8221;&mdash;perhaps he used
a shorter word than &#8220;considerable,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;or I&#8217;ll
hang you in front of headquarters. There&#8217;s no
court of appeals in this camp. Now git!&#8221; as
the last of the supplies were taken out of the
wagon by the regimental commissary.</p>

<p>We were all a little bit sorry that the poor
farmer should lose his entire load. And yet
we sympathized with old Jones&#8217;s remark as he
walked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach these thieves that they can&#8217;t loot
a camp that I&#8217;m a runnin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A DEAD MAN&#8217;S MESSAGE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">DICK FULCHER was the best natured
man in the battery, and he was nothing
else.</p>

<p>He was entirely ignorant and entirely content
to be so. He could neither read nor write,
and we could never persuade him to try to
learn. He had nothing resembling pride in his
composition apparently, nothing that it would
do to call a character.</p>

<p>One morning the alarm came that the enemy
had landed below, and we were ordered hurriedly
forward. Fulcher had just taken post
as stable-guard, and was, therefore, under no
obligation of duty to go. He quietly threw
down the musket he was carrying, and, going
up to the sergeant-major, said: &#8220;Major, can&#8217;t
I be taken off guard? I want to go with the
battery into the fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>His request was granted, of course. He was
number four at Joe&#8217;s gun; number four is the
man who pulls the lanyard, or string, that fires
the gun. When we unlimbered to the front
on Yemassee Creek, within pistol-shot range of
the advancing enemy, Fulcher was laughing as
usual, and apparently as indifferent to the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
he was doing as he had been to everything else,
since we had first known him.</p>

<p>I remember wondering, as I watched him,
why a man who felt so little interest in the
dangerous business had gone out of his way
as he had done to engage in it.</p>

<p>The fire of the enemy was terrific in its destructiveness
from the first. Within the first
three minutes we had lost ten men and a score
of horses. Among the men was Fulcher. He
had fallen, shot through the body, just as the
command was given to him to &#8220;fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lying there upon the ground, with his life
ebbing away, he made a feeble effort to pull
the lanyard; but his strength was too far gone,
and Joe, being short of men, took his place.
He had to stand astride the poor dying fellow,
in order to do his work, for Fulcher&#8217;s wound
was beyond the possibility of a surgeon&#8217;s help.</p>

<p>After two or three more shots of the gun, Joe
heard Fulcher feebly calling to him: &#8220;Joe&mdash;Joe.&#8221;
Inclining his ear, Joe received this last
message: &#8220;I&#8217;m done for, sergeant. But won&#8217;t
you just write to my father and tell him I died
like a man? I&#8217;d like him to know that about
his only boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe wrote the letter and it was blotted with
tears.</p>

<p>After all, it is hard to guess what a man is
made of till you know his motives.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A WOMAN&#8217;S LAST WORD</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE city of Richmond was in flames.</p>

<p>We were beginning that last terrible retreat
which ended the war. Fire had been
set to the arsenal as a military possession,
which must on no account fall into the enemy&#8217;s
hands.</p>

<p>As the flames spread, because of a turn of
the wind, other buildings caught. The whole
business part of the city was on fire. To make
things worse, some idiot had ordered that all
the liquor in the city should be poured into the
gutters.</p>

<p>The rivers of alcohol had been ignited from
the burning buildings, and in their turn had set
fire to other buildings. It was a time and a
scene of unutterable terror.</p>

<p>As we marched up the fire-lined street, with
the flames scorching the very hair off our
horses, George Goodsmith&mdash;the best cannoneer
that ever wielded a rammer&mdash;came
up to the headquarters squad, and said: &#8220;Captain,
my wife&#8217;s in Richmond. We&#8217;ve been married
less than a year. She is soon to become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
a mother. I beg permission to bid her good-by.
I&#8217;ll join the battery later.&#8221;</p>

<p>The permission was granted readily, and
George Goodsmith put spurs to his horse. He
had just been made a sergeant, and was therefore
mounted.</p>

<p>It was in the gray of the morning that he hurriedly
met his wife. With caresses of the tenderest
kind, he bade her farewell. Realizing for a
moment the utter hopelessness of our making
another stand on the Roanoke, or any other
line, he said in bitterness of soul: &#8220;Why
shouldn&#8217;t I stay here and take care of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman straightened herself and replied:
&#8220;I would rather be the widow of a brave man
than the wife of a coward.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was their parting, for the time was very
short. Mayo&#8217;s bridge across the James River
was already in flames when Goodsmith perilously
galloped across it.</p>

<p>Three or four days later, for I never could
keep tab on time at that period of the war, we
went into the battle at Farmville. Goodsmith
was in his place in command of the piece.</p>

<p>Just before fire opened he beckoned to me
and I rode up to hear what he had to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be killed, I think,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
I am, I want my wife to know that she is the
widow of a&mdash;<i>brave man</i>. I want her to know
that I did my duty to the last. And&mdash;and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
you live long enough, and this thing don&#8217;t kill
Mary&mdash;I want you to tell the <i>little one</i> about
his father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goodsmith&#8217;s premonition of his death was one
of many that were fulfilled during the war.</p>

<p>A moment later a fearful struggle began. At
the first fire George Goodsmith&#8217;s wife became
the &#8220;widow of a brave man.&#8221; His body was
heavy with lead.</p>

<p>His son, then unborn, is now a successful
broker in a great city. There is nothing particularly
knightly or heroic about him, for this
is not a knightly or heroic age. But he takes
very tender care of his mother&mdash;that &#8220;widow
of a brave man.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AN INCOMPLETE STORY</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN General Field came to Cairo, Illinois,
after the war, I welcomed him with
especial heartiness.</p>

<p>I was a little bit lonely, lacking comrades in
sympathy with me.</p>

<p>General Field had been my drillmaster at
Ashland, at the war&#8217;s beginning. Later, after
he became a great general, I had many times
been of his following in raids and scouts, and
other military expeditions.</p>

<p>Like all the rest of us at the end of the war,
General Field was very poor. He had come to
Cairo to engage in business, and had not been
able to bring his family with him. So he rented
a bachelor room in the bank building in which
my office was situated, and we two used to spend
the evenings together in front of my office fire.</p>

<p>At that time General Don Carlos Buell was
operating a coal mine in Kentucky, some distance
up the Ohio River. He sold his coal
through the commission house for which I was
attorney.</p>

<p>When he came to Cairo, he, also, usually spent
his evenings in my office.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>One evening General Field was smoking a
long pipe before my fire, and he and I were
chatting about war times&mdash;we hadn&#8217;t yet got
far enough away from the war to regard any
other topic as worthy of intelligent conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The saddest part of it all, to us of the old
army at least,&#8221; said General Field, &#8220;is the breaking
up of old friendships. There&#8217;s Buell, now.
He and I once tented together, messed together,
slept under the same blankets together, and,
without any blankets at all, under the same
frozen sky; marched together, fought together,
suffered together, and endured together. Once
we thought of each other as brothers might.
Now, if we should meet, he would refuse even to
shake my hand. He would regard me as a
rebel&mdash;to him <i>anathema maranatha</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment came a knock at the door.
I opened it, and to my consternation there
stood General Buell.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to say to him that I
was overengaged that evening, and couldn&#8217;t
see him. My second was to invite him to my
bedroom for a special conference, for which I
could profess to have been longing. My third
was to fabricate the story of a telegram, which
should call him immediately to the house of the
head of the firm.</p>

<p>Feeling that none of these devices would answer
the purpose, I thought of the coal-shed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
below; but I remembered that there was no
gas-burner there, and the night was rather a
dark one.</p>

<p>Meantime, General Buell was catching cold
in the hall. So at last I invited him in, taking
pains to call him only by his title, not mentioning
his name. As he entered, Field, who was
always scrupulous in attention to the little niceties
of courtesy, arose to receive the stranger.</p>

<p>When the two gentlemen had bowed to each
other,&mdash;for it was no part of my purpose to introduce
them, if I could help it,&mdash;I turned to
General Buell and said: &#8220;General, I&#8217;m afraid
there is a little discrepancy in the measurement
of those last coal barges. If you have your
memorandum book with you, we&#8217;ll go to the
outer office and straighten the thing up. The
book-keepers are bothered about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas! My little device came to nothing.
Buell had caught sight of Field, and Field had
looked upon Buell. Though years of hard campaigning
had intervened since they had last
met, each recognized the other instantly, and
after a moment&#8217;s hesitation each threw himself
into the other&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Buell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Field!&#8221;</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t tell the rest of this story, because I
didn&#8217;t stay to see it. I don&#8217;t like to see two
men hugging each other with tears in their eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">RANDOM FACTS<br />


<small>ILLUSTRATIVE OF SOUTHERN SOLDIER
CONDITIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE soldiers of the Southern army lacked
many things. Sometimes we lacked
almost everything. We did not always have
clothes, but when we had any, they were apt to
be good ones; they were made of cadet gray
cloth, imported from England through the blockade.
And those Englishmen have a habit of
making uncommonly good cloths.</p>

<p>We were often without shoes; but when we
had shoes, they also came from England, and
were thoroughly good, both in material and
make.</p>

<p>But towards the end of the war, we lacked
many essential things. We lacked medicines
for one thing, and quinine, especially. I remember
that one gentlewoman was deemed a
peculiar patriot, because she got through the
lines with one hundred and forty ounce bottles
of quinine hung inside her hoop-skirt.</p>

<p>For lack of that and other drugs, our surgeons
had to resort to many substitutions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
Some of these were discoveries of permanent
value. That is why the medical profession has
studied with interest the records of our Southern
surgeon-general&#8217;s department, now in possession
of the war department at Washington.</p>

<p>These records, it is said, contribute more than
any other like documents to the science of
medicine.</p>

<p>Another thing that we terribly lacked was
gunpowder&mdash;the one supreme agent of all warfare.
Our fire was often compulsorily made as
light as possible, in order to spare our cartridge
boxes.</p>

<p>To supply this rudimentary need, the women
of the country diligently dug up the earthen
floors of all their smokehouses, and all their
tobacco barns, and rendered out the nitre they
contained. Some of them even destroyed their
tobacco crops by boiling, in order to extract the
precious salt necessary to the destruction of
their enemy.</p>

<p>In the cities, our womenkind were requested
to preserve and deliver to government collectors
all those slops that contain nitre.</p>

<p>It was in this way alone that we got gunpowder
enough to maintain resistance to the
end. And we had equally to pinch in other
ways in order that we might continue to be
&#8220;fighting men.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the window-weights in all the houses, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
all the other leaden things that could be melted
down, were converted into bullets. Even then
we ran dreadfully short towards the end of the
war. At Petersburg, good soldiers felt it to be
their duty to spend all their spare time in collecting
the multitudinous bullets with which the
ground was everywhere strewn. These battered
missiles turned into the arsenals were remoulded
and came back to us in the form of effective,
fixed ammunition.</p>

<p>When we marched to meet Grant in the Wilderness,
in the spring of 1864, we were about
the most destitute army that ever marched to
meet anybody, anywhere. We had nothing to
transport, and we had no transportation.</p>

<p>At the beginning of every campaign it is
customary for the commanding general to issue
an order, setting forth the allotment of baggage
wagons to officers and men. Just before we
marched that spring some wag in the army had
printed and circulated a mock order from General
Lee, a copy of which now lies before me.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">General Orders, Number 1.<br />
Headquarters, Army of Northern Virginia</span>,<br />
April 20, 1864.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The allotment of baggage wagons to the officers and
men of the Army of Northern Virginia during the coming
campaign will be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>To every thirty officers.... No baggage wagon.</p>

<p>To every three hundred men.... Ditto.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) <span class="smcap">Robert E. Lee</span>, General.</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>This order was a good-natured forgery, of
course. Nevertheless it was carried out to the
letter. The fact is that we had no baggage and
no baggage wagons. The only baggage wagons
I ever heard of in connection with that campaign
were a few that General D. H. Hill summoned
for a special occasion. His musicians put in a
petition at the beginning of the summer&#8217;s work
for wagons to carry their instruments. He
assented instantly, and ordered the wagons
brought up. As soon as the instruments were
comfortably deposited within them, he turned
to his quartermaster and said: &#8220;Send those
wagons to Richmond.&#8221; Then turning to his
adjutant he said: &#8220;Have muskets issued to
these men immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>General D. H. Hill was not a man from whose
orders anybody under him was disposed to
appeal.</p>

<p>We entered that campaign stripped almost to
the buff. We had no tents, even for the highest
officers. We had no canteens. We had no
haversacks. We had no knapsacks. We had
no oilcloths to sleep on. We had no tin cups.
We had almost no cooking utensils and almost
no blankets. We had no shoes, and our socks
had long ago been worn out. We had an average
of one overcoat to every thousand men.</p>

<p>It was in this condition of destitution that
we entered the battles in the Wilderness. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
Federal army was as much oversupplied as we
were underfurnished with all the necessaries of
campaigning. What with a perfectly equipped
quartermaster&#8217;s department, a sanitary commission
volunteering superfluous tin cups and everything
else and with other sources of lavish supply,
public and private, every Federal soldier entered
the campaign carrying about three times as
much as any soldier should carry. The moment
there was fighting to be done, they shed all
these things&mdash;as a man throws off his overcoat
when there is work to do.</p>

<p>In the shiftings and changes of position that
occurred during that most irregular of all
possible contests, we were thrown often into
positions where the shedding had been done.
The first thought of every man of us was to
equip himself with such necessaries as were
lying about. It took us a week to get rid of
the superfluous plunder, and reduce ourselves
again to the condition of soldiers in light marching
order.</p>

<p>The one worst lack of all we could not supply
in this way. That was the lack of food. It
was an army of starving men that fought those
battles in the Wilderness. It was an army of
starving men that confronted Grant at Spottsylvania.
It was an army of starving men that
faced the guns at Cold Harbor, at Bottom&#8217;s
bridge, and all the way to Petersburg. Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
until we were established in the works there,
did any man have enough food in a week to
supply his physical needs for a day. I have
elsewhere in these stories illustrated this fact
somewhat, but as it was the central fact in
connection with that campaign, it seems to me
important here to state it in its fulness.</p>

<p>At Petersburg we began to get something
like regular rations, though they were very
meagre and of extremely bad quality. It was,
perhaps, under the influence of this prolonged
starvation and hard work that the men fell
victims to the great religious revival of that
time. It was the ecstasy of anchorites. It
proved, if anything ever did, the efficacy of
fasting as an inducement to fervid prayer.
Saint Simeon Stylites perched on top of his
tower was no better subject of religious enthusiasm
than were these worn out and starved
veterans, whose cause was an object of perpetual
worship. They believed no longer in
themselves; they no longer looked even to
their generals for results. The time and the
mood had come when they trusted God alone to
give them victory. Starvation had made them
devotees.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MY FRIEND PHIL<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor"><small>[2]</small></a></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">TO begin with, Phil was black.</p>

<p>The reader will please understand that
the word &#8220;black&#8221; is here used in its literal, and
not in its conventional, sense. Phil was actually
as well as ethnologically black. There was no
trace of a lighter tint anywhere in his complexion.
Not a suspicion of brown appeared in his
cheeks, and even his great thick lips, protruding
far beyond the outposts of his nose, were
as sable as the rest of his face. It was all a
dead black, too, unaccompanied by that lustre
which, by surface reflection, relieves the shadow
upon commonplace African faces.</p>

<p>And nobody knew all this better than Phil
did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil ain&#8217;t none o&#8217; yer coffee-colored niggas,&#8221;
he would say in moments of exultation, when
his mood was to straighten his broad shoulders
and boast a little. &#8220;Phil ain&#8217;t none o&#8217; yer
coffee-colored niggas, ner none o&#8217; yer <i>alapacker</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
niggas, nuther. Ise black, I is. Dat&#8217;s sho&#8217;.
Ain&#8217;t got no bacon-rind shine in <i>my</i> skin; but I
jes&#8217; tell yer what, mastah, Phil kin jes&#8217; take the
very shut offen dem shiny niggas an&#8217; hoff an&#8217;
hoff niggas, when&#8217;t comes to de wuk. Drive?
Kin I? Kin Phil drive? What yer mean,
mastah, by axin&#8217; such a question?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody had asked Phil such a question; but
Phil had some remarks that he wanted to make
on the subject of his accomplishments in this
respect, and was disposed to answer what he
wished somebody would ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drive? Co&#8217;se I kin. Der never was a hoss
ner mule yit whatever had a mouf an&#8217; two
laigs dat Phil can&#8217;t han&#8217;le, an&#8217; yer better b&#8217;lieve,
mastah, Phil can plaunt de wheel &#8217;twix&#8217; de acorn
an&#8217; de shell.&#8221;</p>

<p>If I report Phil&#8217;s boastings, it is only because
they constitute too large a proportion of what
he said to be omitted. I do so to confirm, not
to gainsay them, or to hold their author up to
ridicule.</p>

<p>He was my friend, the faithfulest one I ever
knew, and now he is dead.</p>

<p>If he boasted now and then, no one could
have had a better right. His was the pride of
performance, and not the vanity of pretension.</p>

<p>Phil was a Virginian&mdash;and a gentleman in
his way&mdash;and a slave, though I doubt if he
ever suspected his gentility, or felt his bondage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
as a burden in the least. He had no aspirations
for freedom or for anything else, I think, except
jollity and comfort. I do not say that this was
well, but it was a fact.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with Phil began when I was
a half-grown boy. Until that time I had lived
in a free state, so that when I had returned to
the land of my fathers, and become an inmate of
the old family mansion in one of the south-side
counties of Virginia, the plantation negro was a
fresh and very interesting study to me.</p>

<p>On the morning after my arrival, as I lay in
the antique carved bed assigned to me, wondering
at the quaint picturesqueness of my surroundings,
and the delightful strangeness of the
life which I was now in contact with for the
first time, a weird, musical sound, of singular
power and marvellous sweetness, floated through
the open dormer windows, borne upon the breath
of such a June morning as I had never before
seen. I listened, but could make nothing of it
by guessing. It was music, certainly, at least a
&#8220;concord of sweet sounds.&#8221; It rose and fell
like the ground swell of the sea, and was as full
of melody and sweetness as is the song of birds,
but it was as destitute as they of anything like
a tune. It began nowhere, and went nowhither.
I had no memory of anything with which to
compare it, and could conceive of no throat or
instrument capable of producing such a sound.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
On the great piazza below, at the front of the
house, sat the master of the mansion. Of him I
straightway made inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; I asked curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil,&#8221; answered my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is &#8216;Phil,&#8217; and what on earth is he
doing, and especially how is he doing it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is calling the hogs, and you may be sure
he is doing it well. If you&#8217;ll walk up to that
skirt of woods, you can put your other questions
to him in person. He is not shy or difficult of
approach. Introduce yourself&mdash;be sure to tell
him whose son you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>My uncle&#8217;s face wore an amused smile as I
walked away. He could imagine the sequel.</p>

<p>In the edge of the timber stood a tall, broad-shouldered,
brawny negro man. He was singularly
ugly, but with a countenance so full of
good humor that I was irresistibly attracted
by it from the first. At his feet stood great
baskets of corn, and around him were gathered
a hundred or more swine, busily eating the
breakfast he was dispensing. As I approached,
his hat&mdash;what there was of it&mdash;was doffed.
I was greeted with a fabulous bow, apparently
meant to be half a tribute of respect, and half a
bit of buffoonery, indulged in for my amusement
or his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good mawnin&#8217;, young mastah. I hope I
see you well dis mawnin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;Thank you, I&#8217;m very well,&#8221; I replied.
&#8220;You&#8217;re Phil, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, fo&#8217; dis wunst, young mastah.
Ise Phil toe be sho&#8217;. Ax der hawgs&mdash;dey done
know me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Phil, I&#8217;m glad to make your acquaintance.
I&#8217;m your mas&#8217; Jo&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What dat? Mas&#8217; Jo&#8217;s son! <span class="smcap">Mas&#8217; Jo&#8217;s
son!!</span> MY MAS&#8217; JO&#8217;S SON!!! Lem me
shake han&#8217;s wid you, mastah. Jes&#8217; to think!
<span class="smcap">Mas&#8217; Jo&#8217;s son!</span> An&#8217; Phil done live to shake
han&#8217;s wid mas&#8217; Jo&#8217;s son. Why, my young
mastah, I done raise your father! Him an&#8217; me
done play ma&#8217;bles togeder many and many a
time. We was boys togeder right heah, on dis
very identumcal plauntation. Used to go in
swimmin&#8217; togeder, an&#8217; go fishin&#8217; an&#8217; steal de
mules out&#8217;n de stables Sundays, an&#8217; ride races
wid &#8217;em and git cotched, too, sometimes when
ole mastah git home from chu&#8217;ch. <span class="smcap">My Mastah.</span>
But Ise glad to see yer.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this while the great giant was wrenching
my hand well-nigh off, laughing and weeping
alternately, and stamping with a delight which
could find no other vent than in physical exertion.
I was naturally anxious to divert the conversation
into some other and less personal
channel, and managed to do so presently by
asking Phil to give me a specimen of his hog-calling
cry, which I wished to hear near at hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
That performance over, we talked again. I
began by saying I had never heard any one call
hogs in that way before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s jes&#8217; it, mastah,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Folks
don&#8217;t understan&#8217; de <i>science</i> o&#8217; hog-callin&#8217;. Dey
says &#8216;p-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-r&#8217;og,&#8217; when de hogs ain&#8217;t po&#8217;
at all, but fat as buttah. Dey got to git &#8216;hog&#8217;
in some ways so dey thinks. But dey ain&#8217;t no
sense in dat. Hogs don&#8217;t understan&#8217; dat. Dey
can&#8217;t talk an&#8217; don&#8217;t understan&#8217; de meanin&#8217; o&#8217;
talk words. You mus&#8217; jes&#8217; let &#8217;em know dat
when you wants &#8217;em to come youse gwine to
make a noise, de like o&#8217; which ain&#8217;t in heaven
or yuth. Den dey gits to knowin&#8217; what dat
means. Dat&#8217;s my way. When I fetch a yell
at &#8217;em, dey jes&#8217; raise der yeahs, an&#8217; say to der
se&#8217;f: &#8216;Dat dar&#8217;s Phil, fo&#8217; sho&#8217;, an&#8217; Phil&#8217;s de big,
ugly, black nigga wid de bauskets o&#8217; cawn.&#8217;
When you says &#8216;Phil,&#8217; you mean mastah&#8217;s big
nigga what wuks in de fiel&#8217;, an&#8217; plays de banjo,
an&#8217; goes fishin&#8217;; but when de hogs says &#8216;Phil,&#8217;
dey mean a big black fella, wid a big yell into
him, <i>an&#8217;</i> de bauskets o&#8217; cawn. An&#8217; you bettah
b&#8217;lieve dat makes &#8217;em jump up an&#8217; clap dey han&#8217;s
fo&#8217; joy, jes&#8217; like de nigga does when he gets
religion &#8217;nuff to make him shout, an&#8217; <i>not</i> &#8217;nuff
to keep him offen the hen roos&#8217;s. If a nigga
gits &#8217;nuff religion to keep him from stealin&#8217;,
it&#8217;s a mistake. Dey don&#8217;t never mean to do
it, and when dey does, dey ain&#8217;t glad a bit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
an&#8217; dey hurries up an&#8217; sends de surplage
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s respect for what he called &#8220;niggas&#8221; was
exceedingly small, and it was his greatest pleasure
in life to demonstrate their inferiority and
emphasize their shortcomings in a hundred ways.</p>

<p>He was &#8220;head man&#8221; of the hoe hands&mdash;which
is to say he hoed the leading row of
tobacco hills, and was charged with the duty of
superintending the work of the others. It was
his delight to keep his work so far in advance
that he must now and then set his hoe in the
ground, and walk back to inspect the progress,
and criticise the performance of slower workers
than he. In all this there was no spice of
uncharitableness or malice, however. He wished
his fellows well, and had no desire to hurt their
feelings; but he keenly enjoyed the fun of outdoing
them, and laughing at their inability to
cope with him.</p>

<p>It was during wheat harvest, however, that
Phil was in his full glory. The rapidity with
which he could &#8220;cradle&#8221; wheat was a matter
of astonishment to every one who knew him,
and, what was more wonderful still, he was
able to maintain a distinctly &#8220;spurting&#8221; speed
all day and every day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil,&#8221; his master would say, as the men
entered the field on the first day, &#8220;I want no
racing now; it&#8217;s too hot.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>&#8220;Now you heah dat, you slow niggas!
Mastah says Phil mustn&#8217;t kill his niggas, an&#8217;
de onliest way to save yo&#8217; lives is fer yer not
to try to follow me. Jes&#8217; take yo&#8217; time, boys.
Race a little among yo&#8217;selves, if yer want to,
but don&#8217; yer try to get a look at de heels o&#8217;
my boots, if yer don&#8217; want to go to de bushes
an&#8217; has any intrus&#8217; in mastah.&#8221;</p>

<p>A negro, exhausting himself in a race, lies
down in the bushes to cool off and recuperate,
and hence the winner of the race is said to
send the others &#8220;to the bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s preliminary remarks were sure to exasperate
his fellows and put them on their mettle.
Silently they would determine to &#8220;push&#8221;
him, and the utmost vigilance of the master
was taxed to prevent dangerous overexertion.
If the reapers were left alone for half an hour,
several of them would be sure to overtask their
strength, and retire exhausted to the friendly
shade of the nearest thicket. But they never
succeeded in coming up with Phil, or in so tiring
him that he was not ready for a dance or
a tramp when night came.</p>

<p>He was a strong man, rejoicing in his strength
always; but there was one thing he would not
do&mdash;he would not work for himself.</p>

<p>His master was one of those who hoped for
gradual emancipation, as many Virginians did,
and thought it his duty to prepare his negroes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
for freedom, so far as it was possible for him
to do so. Among other means to this end, he
encouraged each to make and save money on
his own account. Each was expected to cultivate
a &#8220;patch&#8221; of his own. Their master
gave them the necessary time and the use of
the mules whenever their crops needed attention.</p>

<p>In this way he thought to train them in
habits of voluntary industry and thrift; and
some of them, having no necessary expenses
to bear, accumulated very pretty little hoards
of cash from the sale of their crops every
year. But Phil would not raise a crop for
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I want to raise a crop for?&#8221; he would
ask. &#8220;I don&#8217; want no money, on&#8217;y a quarter
sometimes to buy a banjo string or a fish line,
an&#8217; I get plenty o&#8217; quarters pitched at me when
I hol&#8217; de gentlemen&#8217;s hosses. I don&#8217; want no
money, an&#8217; I wouldn&#8217;t know what to do wid
it if I had it. My mastah takes good care o&#8217;
me, an&#8217;s long as dar&#8217;s a piece o&#8217; meat in de
smokehouse, Phil knows he&#8217;s gwine to have
plenty to eat. I ain&#8217;t gwine to earn no money
an&#8217; be cas&#8217;in&#8217; &#8217;flections on my mastah. My
mastah gives me mo&#8217; clo&#8217;es &#8217;an I kin war out;
an&#8217; <i>what de devil</i> I want to be makin&#8217; money
for, I donno.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was of no use to argue the matter. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
mind was quite made up, and there was no possibility
of changing it.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s marital philosophy was unique. He
changed wives half a dozen times while I knew
him, but one set of rules governed his choice in
every instance. There were certain qualifications
of a rather singular sort, which he deemed
essential in a wife. She must not live on the
plantation for one thing, or on one of those immediately
adjoining, &#8220;&#8217;Cause den we&#8217;re sho&#8217; to
see too much o&#8217; one anoder, an&#8217; &#8217;ll git tired o&#8217;
de &#8217;rangement.&#8221; In the second place he would
marry none but <i>old</i> women, &#8220;&#8217;Cause de young
ones is no &#8217;count anyway. Dey don&#8217; half take
car&#8217; o&#8217; dey husban&#8217;s stockin&#8217;s and things. &#8217;F
you want holes in yer stockin&#8217;s an&#8217; buttons off
yer shut collahs, jes&#8217; you marry a young gal.&#8221;
The third requisite was that the wife should be
a slave, and the daughter of slaves on both
sides. This qualification he insisted upon, even
in the choice of masculine associates. His contempt
for &#8220;free niggas&#8221; was supreme, almost
sublime. He neglected no possible opportunity
of villifying them, and practised no sort of
economy in his expenditure of invective upon
them.</p>

<p>Most of the negroes&mdash;in Virginia, at least&mdash;were
very religious. Naturally their religion
was intensely emotional in its character,&mdash;ecstatic,
sombre, gloomy,&mdash;and quite as naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
it was largely colored with superstition. But religion
of this kind had no charm for Phil, who,
as the reader may possibly have guessed, prided
himself on being strictly logical in all his views
and actions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bro&#8217; Ben,&#8221; he said to one of his fellows one
day, &#8220;youse done got religion, I heah. Anyway,
your face is twict as long as it ought to be.
Has yer got religion fo&#8217; sho&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Phil, I don&#8217;t want none o&#8217; your wickedness.
Bless de Lord, Ise <i>got</i> religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you <i>is</i> got it, is you? Now lemme ax
yer a question or two. Youse got religion, yer
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben: &#8220;Yes, Ise got religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil: &#8220;Well, den, you&#8217;re gwine to heaven
after while&mdash;when yer dies?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben: &#8220;Yes, Ise got de &#8217;surance o&#8217; dat, bro&#8217;
Phil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil: &#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; gone to hell, if you
hadn&#8217;t got de &#8217;surance, as you calls it, wouldn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben: &#8220;If I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; died in my sins, course I&#8217;d
&#8217;a&#8217; gone to hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil: &#8220;Well now fo&#8217; a nigga what&#8217;s jes&#8217; made
his &#8217;rangements to keep out&#8217;n hell an&#8217; git into
heaven, youse got de mos&#8217; onaccountable long
face I ever did see, an&#8217; dat&#8217;s all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Ben had retired in disgust, I remonstrated
with Phil.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>&#8220;What do you tease Ben for, Phil?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;You know better than to make fun of religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course I do, mastah, an&#8217; dat&#8217;s jes&#8217; it. Ben
ain&#8217;t got no religion, an&#8217; I knows it. He&#8217;s jes&#8217;
puttin&#8217; on dat solemncholy face to fool de good
Lord wid. Ben&#8217;ll steal, mastah, whenever he
gits a chaunce. He ain&#8217;t got no mo&#8217; religion &#8217;n
a hog. Sho. What he know &#8217;bout religion,
goin&#8217; down under de hill to pray, an&#8217; all dat
nonsense? Couldn&#8217;t git him to sing a song or
whistle a tune now on no account whatsumever,
but he ain&#8217;t no better nigga for dat.
Didn&#8217;t I see? He shouted mighty loud las&#8217;
night, but he shu&#8217;ked his wuk dis mawnin&#8217; an&#8217;
didn&#8217;t half curry his mules; an&#8217; religion dat
don&#8217;t make a nigga take good car&#8217; o&#8217; po&#8217; dumb
creeters like mules ain&#8217;t wuth nuthin&#8217; at all, no
way yo&#8217; kin fix it. When dey keeps de row up
jes&#8217; a little better, an&#8217; don&#8217;t cover up no weeds
dey ought to cut down, an&#8217; takes good car&#8217; o&#8217;
mules, an&#8217; quits stealin&#8217;, den I begins to &#8217;spect
&#8217;em o&#8217; havin&#8217; de real religion. But dey can&#8217;t
fool Phil wid none o&#8217; dere sham solemncholies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was a trifle hard and uncharitable, perhaps,
in his judgments upon his fellows in a
matter of this kind; but there was, at any rate,
no hypocrisy in his composition. And what is
more singular still, I was never able to discover
any trace of superstition in his conduct. He
laughed to scorn the signs and omens with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
which the other negroes were perpetually encouraged
or affrighted. Friday was as lucky
a day as any in his calendar. He would even
make his fire with the wood of a lightning-riven
tree, and stranger still, was not afraid, as all the
rest were, on the occasion of a funeral, to bring
away the shovels used in the church-yard, without
waiting till the moon and stars had shone
upon them.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it, Phil,&#8221; I once asked him, &#8220;that
you don&#8217;t believe in any of the luck signs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you b&#8217;lieve in &#8217;em, mastah?&#8221; he asked
in reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course not, but all the black folks
do, except you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mastah, ain&#8217;t you foun&#8217; out yit dat niggas
is bawn fools? When my mastah wants de
hogs changed from one piece o&#8217; woods to
annuder, he don&#8217;t go to makin&#8217; blin&#8217; signs to
me, but he comes an&#8217; tells me what he wants;
an&#8217; de good Lord what made de wuld, he ain&#8217;t
a-goin&#8217; to make no blin&#8217; signs, nuther. He&#8217;s
done tole us in de good book an&#8217; in all de wuld
aroun&#8217; us what to do. He&#8217;s put sense in our
heads to un&#8217;erstan&#8217; what he means, an&#8217; he ain&#8217;t
gwine to govern de univarse wid a lot o&#8217; luck
signs, like a nigga would do it. &#8217;Sides, Ise
done all de unlucky things heaps o&#8217; times, an&#8217;
ain&#8217;t never had no bad luck yit.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the war came, Phil was a stanch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Southerner in all his feeling, and firmly held
to his faith in the success of his side, even to
the end. The end crushed him completely.
When his master explained to the colored
people their new condition of freedom, and proposed
to engage them for wages, Phil stoutly
refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;De odder folks may do as dey pleases, mastah,
but Phil&#8217;s gwine to be your nigga jes&#8217; as
he always was. I ain&#8217;t gwine to be free nohow.
I ain&#8217;t got no free nigga blood in me. I never
saw no free nigga what wasn&#8217;t hungry; an&#8217; I
don&#8217;t know no free nigga what <i>won&#8217;t steal</i>;
more&#8217;n dat, I never know&#8217;d a free nigga what
wouldn&#8217;t sneak up on birds an&#8217; <i>shoot &#8217;em on de
groun&#8217;</i>. I tell you, I ain&#8217;t gwine to be no sich
folks as dem. Ise your nigga, an&#8217; Ise gwine to
be jes&#8217; dat. I&#8217;ll do my wuk, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;
to take no wages, an&#8217; you&#8217;ll take car&#8217; o&#8217; me jes&#8217;
as you always did, on&#8217;y don&#8217;t never call me no
free nigga. Ise a slave, I is, an&#8217; Ise got de
bes&#8217; mastah in ole Virginy, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t fool
&#8217;nough to want to change de sitiwation.&#8221;</p>

<p>His master explained to him the necessity of
the case, and showed him how impossible it was,
by any mutual agreement, to alter the fact of
freedom, or to escape its consequences.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must accept wages, Phil, for I may die
or go into bankruptcy, and you may grow old
or get ill; and if I should be poor or dead, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
there would be nobody to take care of you.
You must work for wages and take care of your
money, so that it may take care of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mastah, do you mean to tell Phil dat de law
makes me a free nigga whedder or no?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Phil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Den stick yo&#8217; fingers in yo&#8217; years, mastah,
&#8217;cause Ise gwine to swear. <i>Damn</i> de law. Dat&#8217;s
what I say about dat. An&#8217; now Ise jus&#8217; gwine
to die, an&#8217; dat&#8217;s all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor fellow walked away with bowed
head and tear-stained face. The broad, stalwart
shoulders were bent beneath the weight of responsibility
for himself. He was a strong man,
physically, but the merest child in character,
and the feeling that he no longer had any one
but himself to lean upon, was more than he
could bear. The light of cheerfulness and good
humor went out of his face. The joyousness of
his nature disappeared, and before the summer
had ripened into autumn, poor Phil lay down
and died of a broken heart.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;There are passages in this book which are as strong
and captivating as the work of the best writers of the
day; to mariners and those who love the sea and ships
these tales will appeal irresistibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Each story is a gem by itself. It is told with a directness
and a strength which carries conviction. All are
based upon actual occurrences, Mr. Barnes tells us, and
while some of the incidents related may come under the
head of tradition, yet most of them are historical facts, and
he has worked up each tale so cleverly, so compactly, so
entertainingly, that they may, one and all, be taken for
models of their kind.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Seaboard.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Good stories well told are those of &#8216;Yankee Ships and
Yankee Sailors,&#8217; They deal with the gallant defenders of
such vessels as the <i>Chesapeake</i>, the <i>Vixen</i>, the fiery little
<i>Wasp</i>, and grand &#8216;<i>Old Ironsides</i>.&#8217; All the stories are
told in a spirited style that will quicken the blood and the

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Every line of this hits the mark, and to anyone who
knows the forecastle and its types the picture appeals with
the urgency of old familiar things. All through his four
hundred and more pages he is equally unaffected and
forcible, equally picturesque. To go through one chapter
is to pass with lively anticipation to the next. His book
is destined to be remembered.&#8221;&mdash;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The book reads like a romance, but is at the same
time realistic history, before which the fancy ships and the
fancy sailors of the novelist are pale and faded.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Baltimore
Sun.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The charm of the book is its simplicity and truth.
The author, as I happen to know, can spin thrilling yarns
by the hour, and this book of his is simply one long yarn
of his life. A seaman every inch of him, he writes as
only a sailor can. No landsman, no amateur yachtsman,
could write a book like this. The entire book bears the
stamp of truth, and in this age of literary shams that is a
crowning merit.&#8221;&mdash;<i>New York Herald.</i></p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,

other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
